      <p>&lsquo;Where's my old gang done gone?' <br />
I heard a sad man say, <br />
I whispered in that sad man's ear, <br />
&lsquo;Your gang's done gone away.' </p>

      <p>Angelo Dosan is the fighter-turned-mage who served as your brother's henchman
        in Baldur's Gate. You may remember that he sentenced you to death and fought
        against you in the Undercity, and if you were lucky enough to mine the content,
        you may remember that he is Shar-Teel's father. Most likely he didn't survive
        your game, but people in this world seem to have a knack for not staying
        dead. </p>
      <p>In the Angelo <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Mod, Angelo
        tracks you down in the Graveyard District to make you an offer you can't
        refuse (though perhaps you will). He comes equipped with the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Between two and five banters with every Bioware <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>,
          except for Cernd (none) and Mazzy (one) </li>
        <li>Extensive player-initiated conversation trees </li>
        <li>A full array of interjections </li>
        <li>Voicing </li>
        <li>Custom equipment </li>
        <li>A new merchant </li>
        <li>For those curious about the past, the player can ask Angelo to unfold
          the story of Sarevok as he saw it. Of course, should Sarevok himself ever
          join the party, the plot may thicken. </li>
        <li>Angelo has two major quests&mdash;both in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>,
          one of which can carry into <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>. </li>
        <li>If you are female, are of <strong>any </strong> race and have at least
          twelve charisma, you can attempt to romance Angelo. It's a rocky road,
          but may reward players looking for something different. </li>

      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
      The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
      Angelo for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-angelo.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>angelo</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-angelo.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-angelo.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        The Angelo for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-angelo</strong>, <strong>setup-angelo.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>angelo</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-angelo.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-angelo.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Angelo for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall angelo in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-angelo --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

    <p>Angelo is a risky PG-13 or a tame R, extremely high in suggestion but low in graphica. Your play experience may vary. Angelo isn't very respectful of women, and under certain circumstances he tells several “disguised” racist jokes that may offend some. There are passing homosexual themes. There is also a scene of potential hard drug use, if the player allows him/herself to get peer-pressured… </p>

      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Is Angelo <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>?<br />
      <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Yes. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Is the mod compatible? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Yes. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Angelo's name or soundest is messed
        up! <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Select Angelo in the game and press &ldquo;K.&rdquo; This
        should fix the problem. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I'm having trouble installing Angelo
        on my Mac. I try using the install command but I just get an error message. <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: I, the author, am a Mac user, and I
        had this problem myself. I'm told you can either use &ldquo;StuffIt&rdquo; to expand
        the archive, or this process (suggested by a player of Kulyok's Xan <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>)
        worked for me: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Open the Terminal, type &lsquo;chmod +x' followed by a space, drag Setup-Angelo.command
          into the window, press enter. </li>
        <li> Type &lsquo;chmod 755' followed by a space, drag Setup-Angelo into the window,
          press enter. </li>
        <li> Double-click Setup-Angelo.command, the installation process should now
          proceed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Angelo isn't just going to betray
        me, is he? I don't think I could handle that again. <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Of course I can't say absolutely, but
        rest assured, if you want him he's in for the long haul. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Why can't I take off Angelo's clothes? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: For a number of reasons, both balance-related
        and aesthetic, this seemed to me the best solution. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: What good is Angelo combat-wise? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: I always thought fighter-mages were
        under-utilized in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>&mdash;Haer'Dalis
        is one of the few. For example, a lot of neat defensive spells are caster-only,
        and some of the later spells (like energy drain) are touch range...but basically,
        Angelo is a competent fighter and a competent mage, he can use katanas, and
        he should fall somewhere between Valygar and Haer'Dalis in style. He has
        seven levels in fighter and advances as mage. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Angelo has no dual-wielding dots!
        Why? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: It just isn't his style; he only had
        seven levels of fighter to learn to use one weapon effectively, and he isn't
        the strongest or most dexterous guy. If you really want, you can start putting
        dots there. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Is there anyone I should take in
        my party to get the most of the content? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Angelo has a bond with characters from
        the previous game. I would STRONGLY recommend taking Imoen. Jaheira, Keldorn,
        Minsc, Edwin and Valygar are also good picks, and Haer'Dalis contributes
        to the romance (this takes some time to pay off, but I would argue that it
        is worth it). There is a romance conflict with Anomen, though not an epic
        one. Taking on Sarevok is recommended in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: My favorite character doesn't get
        picked on, does he/she? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Angelo has his own likes and dislikes
        (which he will be quite vocal about), but honestly, I don't have a strong
        personal bias against anyone. I think I tried to keep things balanced (except
        for Cernd).* </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I can understand taking him along,
        but why on earth would my <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>,
        poor [CHARNAME], want to romance him? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: This is an excellent question that Angelo
        himself will raise. There is someone for everyone, though, and Angelo may
        be just what a certain <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> is
        looking for. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Any tips on playing the romance? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Angelo may seem slow to come around.
        You are given plenty of opportunities to break off the romance but it can
        potentially last until the epilogue. When the gift horse comes knocking,
        don't look it in the mouth. </p>
      <p>Aside from a charisma of 12+, there are no restrictions on the romance,
        alignment or racial. However the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>'s
        responses tend to be articulate, so it might not make sense to do it with
        your INT 6 half-orc. Likewise, it might not make sense for a <em>very </em> evil
        character, unless you plan to cruelly string him along with lies (which is
        quite possible). The responses offered should cover a nice spectrum from
        lawful good to neutral or lawful evil. </p>
      <p>IMPORTANT: If Anomen comes asking you about the romance, be honest with
        him! You will be held to what you say. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Will I miss out on anything if I
        don't play the romance (or vice-versa)? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Yes, the romancing player will find
        out things about Angelo they wouldn't otherwise. There is no separate &ldquo;friendship&rdquo; track&mdash;the
        romance has most of the &ldquo;base&rdquo; content and more. He still has plenty to say
        to the male or uninterested female <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>,
        though, and there is a small amount of male-specific content. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Can I romance Angelo as a male? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: You can attempt to&mdash;let's just say Angelo
        has been around the block. When it comes to that, though, he may provide
        certain romantic assets for the heterosexual male <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: If I don't romance Angelo, will he
        romance another <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: He'll certainly try his damnedest. The
        answer is no, though. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: What language is Angelo speaking
        when he attacks? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Japanese. I hope it doesn't break the
        mood, but I consider it a translation of his Kara-Turan language, just as
        most of the English is presumably a translation&mdash;and Yoshimo does it, too. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Why is he half Kara-Turan, for that
        matter? </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I don't really know about the names
        in Forgotten Realms, but Dosan sounded Kara-Turan to me (in real life it's
        the name of a Tae Kwon Do form, which would make it Korean). I can only say
        that it seemed right&mdash;and is the substance of a lot of jokes. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Why does Angelo say &lsquo;holla?' Isn't
        that, like, West Coast? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Hamlet, act 1 scene 1. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Come to think of it, isn't there
        a lot of Shakespeare in here? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Everyone has to steal from somewhere;
        I figured it might as well be Shakespeare. It was either that or Evanescence
        lyrics. </p>
      <p>I find it highly probably that Angelo was originally named after a character
        from Shakespeare's <em>Measure For Measure </em>, an unjust magistrate who
        sentences a man to death for impregnating his girlfriend. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Hey, aren't you that guy...? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: I wrote a long piece of fanfiction (&ldquo;Fury&rdquo;)
        in which Angelo was a major character. You can find it on ff.net and on the
        Attic (somewhere) if the mod piques your interest. If you happen to have
        read it, Angelo here is a bit different (since the story doesn't exactly
        follow the game); but he has more in common with that Angelo than with the
        one-dimensional minor villain from the game. </p>
      <p>I also voiced Xan <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>/<acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> and
        co-wrote Xan <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> with the amazing
        Kulyok (yes, I'm the guy with that annoying, fake British accent). I voice
        Angelo too. There might be a law against voicing your own mod, but don't
        tell anyone. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Angelo is in the Graveyard District near the northern exit. He will salute
          you, but you have to go up and talk to him. </li>
        <li>You can now find a Kara-Turan cleric of sorts in the Temple District.
          He sells priestly items, including a few unique ones. </li>
        <li>Good katana are hard to come by in the game (especially if, like me,
          you refuse to use the Celestial Fury on principle). Angelo has one proficiency
          dot in a number of other weapons, so if you want to go with one of those
          to bump up to &ldquo;specialized,&rdquo; think carefully&mdash;you only get about one dot
          to spend in all of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>. </li>
        <li> Angelo's &ldquo;talk style&rdquo; is a bit different from other <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>&mdash;he
          isn't used to chatting with his employers, so you're most likely to get
          him talking by talking to him. Later on, when he knows you better, he may
          open up of his own accord. </li>
        <li> In the committed stage of the romance, if you get bored waiting for
          his next talk, you can access player-initiated talks from the dialogue
          option &ldquo;my love, there's something I'd like to talk to you about&hellip;&rdquo; There
          are a limited number of these, so use sparingly. </li>
        <li>The quests both trigger automatically. If at a certain point you're wondering
          what to do next, and you haven't been to the Windspear Hills yet, you might
          want to pay a visit. </li>
        <li>You can't make any &ldquo;fatal&rdquo; mistakes in his quests, although you can do
          plenty of things that are fatal to the player. </li>
        <li>The second quest involves a tough fight. If you do it in chapter 2 or
          3, be prepared. </li>
        <li>There will be conflicts between Angelo and other characters, but nothing
          that <em>has </em> to result in anyone dying or getting kicked out. </li>
        <li>If you go the romance route and also lead on Anomen, at a certain point
          Anomen will confront you. It is important you tell him how you really feel,
          as this talk results in either one or the other romance being broken. </li>
        <li>Angelo will be kidnapped by Bodhi if you romance him. It may not go quite
          as you expect. </li>
        <li>Angelo has a player-initiated comment on every other <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>.
          These will have changed by <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>,
          so you can get some new ones.    </li>

      <p><strong>Quests </strong></p>
      <p><em>These should be more or less sequential to keep from spoiling you more
        than you want to be spoiled. </em></p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I'm stalled in the Bounty Hunter
        quest. Where is the next guy? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: The second party of bounty hunters should
        ambush you in the Windspear Hills. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: And the next guy? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: The final encounter takes place in the
        Docks. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Merzer keeps kicking my ass! <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Merzer has high <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> and
        the fight takes place on the streets of Athkatla, making magic problematic.
        If you've bought your magic license, though, it should be considerably easier. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: What exactly can I do with the lotus
        aside from delivering it? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Inspector Brega and Renal Bloodscalp
        will both be interested. Both options won't appear yet, though, if you're
        talking to either of them for the first time. Try talking to them again.
        Doing this may have&hellip;consequences, however. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I convinced Pierre to change his
        ways and he gave me the money. What am I supposed to do with this bag of
        lotus now? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Sawara only cares about the money. You
        can now turn the lotus in to Brega, or sell it Renal, with impunity (in fact
        although it's never stated, I imagine Sawara will admire you for doing this). </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Sawara keeps kicking my ass! Is this
        fight supposed to be impossible? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Sawara didn't get where he is by being
        a sissy: you're basically fighting the Kara-Turan Aran Linvail. You can beat
        him, but it's not superfluous there is a nonviolent solution. If it's really
        too difficult, try coming back in a later chapter. </p>
      <p>Also, it really helps if you &ldquo;tip the odds&rdquo; as Angelo suggests. You've probably
        figured this out, but if not, a simple conversation could be all it takes. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I don't know what you're talking
        about, I thought he was a cakewalk. <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: See, this guy knows how to do it ^_^ </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: How do I get the second quest to
        continue into <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Part of it will have a continuation
        if you don't return the sword to Ginpachi. Another thread will continue if
        you bribed or charmed Suu. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Am I supposed to do anything with
        this piece of Sawara's finger? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Not immediately, hang onto it. If you
        bribed or charmed Suu, it comes into play in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: I took Sarevok into my party and
        got a journal entry about his conflict with Angelo. Is this a quest? Can
        I resolve it somehow? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Yes. If you get Sarevok to change his
        alignment, there will be a last conversation and the &ldquo;quest&rdquo; will end. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Ginpachi keeps kicking my ass! (hey,
        you never know) <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: This fight can be tough since you walk
        into it without the chance to buff up&mdash;and since you hit it before Amkethran,
        where you can buy items that protect you from backstab. With the right equipment,
        though, it shouldn't be too bad. If you go the romance route, you may have
        gotten an item that will prove useful here. </p>
      <p><strong>Romance </strong></p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: So, seriously, how do I start the
        romance? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Angelo won't come looking for it. Flirt,
        then wait. It might be a while at first. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: There aren't any nasty surprises,
        are there? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Surprises, perhaps; nasty, hopefully
        not ^_^ </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: What should I do to keep from breaking
        the romance? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Humor him. He'll have a lot of questions,
        but in most cases there is no &ldquo;wrong answer&rdquo; except not answering. Also at
        one point, he will make a request of you that you can't turn down (without
        losing him). </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: What point? Spoil me. <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: When he asks you to marry him. There's
        no way to put it off. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: How do I bring Angelo back to life! <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Can you think of anyone who has a connection
        both to Angelo and to the undead? </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: No, seriously, who do I talk to? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Oyaji in the Temple District. </p>
      <p><acronym title="Question">Q</acronym>: Why aren't there more flirts!? <br />
        <acronym title="Answer">A</acronym>: Honestly, I'm not a big fan of descriptive
        text (as opposed to dialogue), but in the name of tradition there are some
        flirts. If you have an idea for one (either just an idea or in your own words)
        I would be happy to consider it, just post it on the forum at <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym>. </p>

      <p>I hope you play and thoroughly enjoy this mod. If you care to stick around
    a moment, though, and hear an amateur modder's thoughts: </p>
      <p>An idea I had in mind when writing Angelo <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> was
        the difference between banal and radical evil. According to Hannah Arendt,
        a great deal of human wickedness&mdash;she had in mind the Nazis&mdash;is essentially
        banal in nature. There is surely a lot of truth in this. But if all evil
        is banal, then where do we get the idea of radical evil from&mdash;and why is it
        so pervasive and alluring in our stories? </p>
      <p>It's something to think about, I think, </p>
