@1    = ~Methinks I recognize yonder Angelo Dosan.~
@2    = ~Who seems to think that cultivating a feeble attempt at a beard has rendered him unrecognizable.~
@3    = ~He would have done better to have a beard, I think, and shaved it off when he got into trouble.~
@4    = ~Silence your blathering, Caius! In any case, we shall be taking him off your hands. Do feel free to resist. Cheers!~
@5    = ~Why do they call themselves the Shadow Thieves? Perhaps if they called themselves Dockside Orphan Charities it would fool at least a guard or two.~
@6    = ~You just saw the man sell out his last employer and now you're going... to... ah... I didn't say anything. Not a word, chief.~
@7    = ~Oh, oh gods, there's no call for that. Let the poor sod die, I say. I hope we won't be working with this fellow long, <CHARNAME>.~
@8    = ~Now obviously no one successfully betrayed anyone, eh? Come on, Yoshi. Let's let bygones be bygones. <CHARNAME>'s the forgiving sort... you've proof of that before your eyes.~
@9    = ~Gods, how corrupt is this city? Where I come from you needed a better line than that.~
@10   = ~I don't like this at all. Against beasts or bandits, all you can lose is your life; but we stand to lose something more here.~
@11   = ~Not again.~
@12   = ~Lady, it's because of your kind the word 'adultery' exists.~
@13   = ~Well, gods bless you, my friends. A tenyear ago I might have joined you.~
@14   = ~You must be tired, lass, on your feet all day. Care for a bit of sport on your back?~
@15   = ~I am a married woman!~
@16   = ~At your age? Well, I pity you.~
@17   = ~Holla! Strict orders from the Shadowmaster, you've been working too hard. I'm to give you a full-body massage, clothing optional.~
@18   = ~Hmm! If only.~
@19   = ~Well, this isn't something you see every day. Might I offer you a glass of water?~
@20   = ~Oh, don't the dead ever STAY dead?~
@21   = ~We'll get him for this, never you fear.--Woah-ho! No need for that glare, I know you could find him single-handed, even as you are now.~
@22   = ~She sounds like a whiner to me. Her husband's all but a gods-damned saint, she should be glad she sees him once in a tenyear.~
@23   = ~Wah-ha-ha! The gods are smiling on us today! ... wait, why so grim?~
@24   = ~Well this ought to be amusing. I hope our tiny friend has his bribe money handy.~
@25   = ~Happen I don't know how sons are meant to treat their fathers, not having the luxury of one myself; but were I you, I'd give him a cuff upside the head, the pissant.~
@26   = ~What the hells are we waiting for? Let's go slit the bastard's throat. Happen as a merchant, he's done something to deserve it any case.~
@27   = ~All hail! All ha-a-a-ail, Sir Anomen! <CHARNAME>, let me fetch some rose blossoms to strew at his feet. "Oh, Sir Anomen, my maiden's heart is fluttering! Take me now!"~
@28   = ~Shut up.~
@29   = ~Why do I get the feeling this is going to be more trouble than it's worth?~
@30   = ~Woah-ho! Now... back up with me for a minute here. He told you to guard the CHEST, that's correct?~
@31   = ~Or close enough, yeah. What's it to you?~
@32   = ~Now when we use words to signify objects, what do we really mean? I'm looking at a chest, here, but what IS it really?~
@33   = ~Hey, hey, I'm not sure I follow you. I wasn't the top of my class in monster school, here.~
@34   = ~Well I spent a year in school, and I've talked with monks of the Way besides, so you can listen to me. Now, supposing I were to cut the chest in half. Where's the damned chest? Or these brass fittings, is that the chest? Let me put forward, my friend, that there is NO chest; only a useful fiction created by our minds.~
@35   = ~Hmmmm. But words still mean something, right?~
@36   = ~Why, certainly, happen we can use them as we see fit. But there's not a binding relation between a word and the thing is signifies.~
@37   = ~Then my order...~
@38   = ~...is null and void, correct. It's a tautology, not a statement of fact. It doesn't touch the world of things as they are, it's only playing the language-game.~
@39   = ~Hee, hee, hee! That old drow wasn't as smart as he thought. I guess I have no orders after all. But then... oh, my head hurts. Which I guess means my whole body hurts.~
@40   = ~Bear witness, chief, that there's one honest girl in the world. Happen when the heavens fall into the sea, she'll still be here minding her charge.~
@41   = ~Gods bless you, Missy--gods bless.~
@42   = ~This is a god? Tired, weak, and in as dire need of his followers as they are of him?~
@43   = ~My god, this is too good to be true. Tell me, m'lady, is there some workshop where they turn out your like? And might you conduct me there?~
@44   = ~I have some advice. Perchance rather than going into the country, we could sleep on the street, eat hay and flies, and take turns making love to a watchman's horse. What do you think?~
@45   = ~You know? I'm glad we came here. Truly I am.~
@46   = ~Mind you, there are people I don't like, but it would set a bad precedent if I could go putting them to the torch in broad daylight. Drow or not, we should put a stop to this.~
@47   = ~Hail there, friend! Ha, ha! Pleasure doing business with you. I have my magic license here in my hand and I'll be molested no further, correct?~
@48   = ~I regret to inform you, sir, that if you travel in the company of an individual without a license, your own document is null and void so long as you remain in their service.~
@49   = ~Is that so! Well, good to day to you, you lily-livered chea--that is, my excellent, noble friend. Ha. Ha.~
@50   = ~Ha, now this is more like it! You're my sort after all, chief.~
@51   = ~Slaves, eh? This is bad business. Still, think it through. A lot of people enjoy themselves here. Perhaps it would be best not to rock the ship, eh?~
@52   = ~I suppose we might as well see this through.~
@53   = ~Oy, you there, in the leather! Don't think I've forgotten the scene ye made last time, dirty old beggar! The poor gal is still recovering. I won't turn away paying custom, but I've got an eye on you; and if you kick up more trouble why, I'll give ye a hiding ye won't soon forget!~
@54   = ~(<CHARNAME>... I'm a bit frightened...)~
@55   = ~Beg pardon, sir, for the muddy track my boot left on your carpet... but wait! Just look at the subtle beauty of this shape. Happen I've made some art!... do I get money, now?~
@56   = ~Woah-hoh! It was, ah, another illusion you saw us killing these knights. We just got here. No idea what's going on. Isn't that right, chief?~
@57   = ~Oh, it would be my pleasure to... "collaborate" with you, my sweet.~
@58   = ~But what's this? I think I spy a tiny bug that used to crawl on the Iron Throne.~
@59   = ~Woah-hoh! Plucked back from death by a higher power, eh? Holla, you ham-fisted lackwit. You know, up till the end, I could get a chuckle out of Sarevok with my impression of you.~
@60   = ~Don't tell me you want to follow <CHARNAME>, too? Sorry, my friend, but the place is taken.~
@61   = ~It'd seem we both serve bigger ones now, runt--but you've packed cards with the weaker. I'll squish your head just as my master will eat up your precious <CHARNAME>.~
@62   = ~Big talk, big man. We'll see about that.~
@63   = ~Stop! You there, m'lord!~
@64   = ~Oh, hells.~
@65   = ~Won't you take responsibility for this little angel? Look at her eyes, m'lord, they are your eyes!~
@66   = ~Ah...<CHARNAME>, I assure you that in spite of all likelihood, this is not what it appears...~
@67   = ~Oh, so cold! You were in the cups that night, but surely you recall our hour of passion?~
@68   = ~Now, m'lady, perhaps we danced, on the floor, in the round... but you are not my lover, and the girl is not my daughter.~
@69   = ~Though if I had traveled this way before in all my life... forgive me. Have a gold piece.~
@70   = ~Thanks, mister! I guess you're what mommy calls a "big sucker!"~
@71   = ~(Hush, child!)~
@72   = ~(sigh)~
@73   = ~Ah-ha! I always knew I'd done one good deed in my life, and now I remember what it was. You slime, you lowest thing to crawl the earth, you won't squirm out of my grip this time. And I'll squeeze from you every last one of your victim's screams. No, you won't get away until you've paid in full.~
@74   = ~N-no! No more beatings! This is not allowed, this... is not...~
@75   = ~No. Hee, hee, hee. YOU can't hurt me now. I'm not in your big house anymore. There won't be any more beatings. No, this time...you are the one who will scream, my angel.~
@76   = ~Gods, just looking at you makes my blood froth. Bear witness, you heavens, that I will be the one to send this devil where he belongs, once and for all!~
@77   = ~Oh-ho, now! You, sir, you have the look of a fellow from the Eastern lands. It's slight, but I've a sharp eye, if I do say so myself.~
@78   = ~I may have called Kara-Tur home, once. What of it?~
@79   = ~Well, it just so happens I have a marvelous little trinket in from Kara-Tur, something to amuse a man of taste.~
@80   = ~A fan or a mirror, I suppose? I warn you, I can tell trash from a genuine article.~
@81   = ~But of course! I'd never doubt it. This is as genuine as genuine comes, a fine accessory to a religious costume. Won't you have a look?~
@82   = ~I... see. Ah, heh. Heh-heh.~
@83   = ~And what have we here? This gentle lady beside you must be your paramour. It would look quite becoming on her sweet head, don't you think?~
@84   = ~Ah, ha, ha! I think you're right! <CHARNAME>, m'lady, try this on!~
@85   = ~It's... a headband. With... are these CAT ears, Angelo?~
@86   = ~What on earth is this supposed to be?~
@87   = ~Absolutely not.~
@88   = ~It's for a festival, chief. Like a headdress. I really think it would flatter you.~
@89   = ~I will not submit myself to this indignity for a moment!~
@90   = ~If you value your life, you will not speak another word!~
@91   = ~No, thank you.~
@92   = ~(sigh) If you insist.~
@93   = ~How cute! Of course I will!~
@94   = ~Woah-ho, the kitten has claws!~
@95   = ~That's it, you're dead!~
@96   = ~Co-ome now. You know you wa-ant to.~
@97   = ~I said no and I mean it!~
@98   = ~I knew you were a sport, chief. Hup! There we are...~
@99   = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, you... truly are... a vision--*snnerk*~
@100  = ~Hah, hah, hah!~
@101  = ~(snort)~
@102  = ~Harr-harr, ha harrr!~
@103  = ~Me next, me next!~
@104  = ~Oh, how adorable!~
@105  = ~This is most unnatural.~
@106  = ~Now this reminds me of my great-aunt Emmy and that unfortunate strain of lycanthropy she came down with...~
@107  = ~Awww!~
@108  = ~My lady, I... must confess I do find it rather becoming...~
@109  = ~Fear not, noble <CHARNAME>, I am keeping my laughter in my heart.~
@110  = ~... Heh.~
@111  = ~I had not thought you could look any more ridiculous, abbil.~
@112  = ~Truly, my raven, your beauty has increased tenfold.~
@113  = ~Boo says you are just as cute as a button, <CHARNAME>! (Though I do not know myself what is so cute about buttons.)~
@114  = ~Whatever Dosan may tell you, you would do best not to show your face in Kara-Tur in such attire. It might attract the wrong sort of attention.~
@115  = ~Truly *gasp* truly I tell you ahahahaha--!~
@116  = ~The next tree, Angelo! That's where I'm going to hang you from!~
@117  = ~Sleep with one eye open tonight, Angelo.~
@118  = ~If there was anything between us, it is over now.~
@119  = ~Can I... keep them?~
@120  = ~I want these. Pay the man, Angelo.~
@121  = ~I knew you would find it to your liking. I'm never mistaken, you see. A mere three gold?~
@122  = ~Does kitty want to pla-ay? Does kitty want to pla-ay?~
@123  = ~Curses, I seem to have dropped a shiny gold coin in the street! Well, go and frolic with it <CHARNAME>, what are you waiting for?~
@124  = ~Heee-harr! Harr!~
@125  = ~*snort* *snerrk*~
@126  = ~Here you are, my friend.~
@127  = ~I mean it! You're dead!~
@128  = ~But he'll not get mine, I tell you. I spent enough gold dying it, I'll not part with it for a song!~
@129  = ~Vicious and stupid, sitting on heaps of treasure? Methinks I like this well.~
@130  = ~Ye gods, I hope yonder lady can't read my thoughts... ~
@131  = ~Chief, I've played many roles in my day, and I've played a lackey; but if my mere manhood makes me a lackey, I may find it more than I can stomach.~
@132  = ~Male? MALE? That's 'Sir' Male to you, wench!~
@133  = ~What did this lickspittle say?~
@134  = ~No one lays a hand on an innocent working girl without having to answer to me!~
@135  = ~There, there; the old hag was jealous, that's all. Do right by this girl, chief.~
@136  = ~Well, chief, I see you're recruiting a higher caliber of ally these days.~
@137  = ~I like animals. They never mean any harm. Couldn't we go break some human skulls instead?~
@138  = ~Now, I enjoy the night as much as the next red-blooded man, but this is taking things one step too far.~
@139  = ~You are a man haunted by the past. You wish nothing more than to forget, but you will not find true peace until you confront your ghosts.~
@140  = ~Well, that was cheerful. For that sum I could have bought a girl who'd say she liked my muscles.~
@141  = ~I have no quarrel with you, Irenicus; but my quarrel is chief's quarrel. Mage or demon or god, you fall here!~ [adang162]
@142  = ~Well, I can hardly say this was unexpected. But... chief, you'll laugh, but I always entertained the hope I just might end up in the other place.~
@143  = ~Does he take bribes? If not, don't trust him. There must be something far worse wrong with him.~
@144  = ~A mage wins by thinking, not just by spells. They have to determine where, when and how you fight them. Get them in their bed when they don't have spells, and their throat cuts like anyone's. Fall back, wait for their wards to flicker off, and you'll find they go down like a heap of twigs.~
@145  = ~How now! I rather expected I'd find you here. You don't seem to know me, so I can only assume you're a shade, a shadow of yourself. No matter. What I'm about to do, I did in my head more than once... chief.~
@146  = ~You know, my friend, they're doing incredible things with wigs these days.~
@147  = ~Oh... Yoshimo. Yoshi. No, no, no. Come on.~
@148  = ~Have a copper. Say a prayer for my soul, my worthy, would you?~
@149  = ~I shall most certainly do so.~
@150  = ~If I had a god it would be Ilmater. Every other one gives you something and he takes everything away. It's crazy, it's crazy as you can get. But they act like he is what he says.~
@151  = ~... Here. Have a piece of candy, lass. Do you like sweets?~
@152  = ~Oh, thank you! I would take your face, uncle... but you have two faces, you see, and I'm not sure which one is you!~
@153  = ~Whichever you like, gods be with you. Now, your uncle has a bad headache.~
@154  = ~They are some smart fellows. Why curry a king's favor when you could curry a god's? But I don't buy it. If Helm were really all-seeing, he'd see those grubbing sots for what they are, wouldn't he?~
@155  = ~Those priests who run orphanages need someone to look after.~
@156  = ~Why do they call them pirates? Because they have one ship. If they had a dozen ships, they'd call them kings.~
@157  = ~Fifty golders would buy you a good sword-arm that didn't run home whenever his little sister took ill.~
@158  = ~What the state takes, the state keeps.~
@159  = ~Gods, man. Dragons? Joust away. Mad ghosts? I'm right behind you. Bureaucracy? We can find you another childhood pal.~ [adang161]
@160  = ~I understand you want your soul back. Listen, are you sure this isn't all in your head? I've been walking around without a soul for some years now, and I feel fine.~
@161  = ~We have the gold to hire enough mercenaries to run this place over six times. Why are we going in with the shirts on our backs and the spittle in our mouths?~
@162  = ~I hate to say this, chief, but you may have met your match.~
@163  = ~Don't take the girl. Don't take the girl. Are you ready for this? Don't take the girl. We can do this without the help of someone who was dumb enough to hire us.~
@164  = ~I've known men who tried to take on dragons. It's not a pretty way to go. This is a bad idea in direct proportion to the size of the pile of gold behind that thing. Ten years hence, all your pretty gear will be sitting there, right where I'm pointing.~
@165  = ~Oh, brother. Mother always told me there'd be days like these.~
@166  = ~Now, I'm just throwing out ideas here. Supposing... we kill the priest. We slap some black paint on your eyelids. We come out... 'Behold, the Great Sightless One has a new prophet! And the Great Sightless One demands... tithes!'~
@167  = ~Anything with the word 'planar' is a patently bad idea. In my experience, 'planar' means 'get your blessed soul ripped out by a demon.'~
@168  = ~Statues? STATUES? You should be mayor! This was all Lord Whatsit's fault. Say the word, <CHARNAME>, I can start working on your campaign.~
@169  = ~<CHARNAME>, don't let that door close behind you.~
@170  = ~Chief, let's not do this. I know you won't listen to me, but let it be noted that I wash my hands of the matter.~
@171  = ~You could do worse. You've trusted one rogue already.~
@172  = ~Trusting this man seems like an excellent idea... ... How was that? I'm brushing up on my sarcasm. A mage and a bureaucrat, chief. Why not trust a Sembian vampire?~
@173  = ~<CHARNAME>, may I draw your attention to the fact that this man is wearing a paisley neckerchief?~
@174  = ~Hmm. I don't like dealing with the Cowled Wizards any more than we have to. But it wouldn't be so hard to get this gang committed to the asylum, would it?~
@175  = ~Give me a whore over a lady any day. Whores know what honor is. You don't know what a thing means till you've lost it. Sure, you have one what'll take your purse afore you wake up, but that's understood. That's why when the business is done you kick her out or you go yourself. But if they rob you they use their hands; a lady uses her tongue.~
@176  = ~You can catch the clap off your lady-love just as well as off Mary Nancy at the Belching Dragon. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I had my hand down my chaps for weeks.~
@177  = ~I won't say this often, chief. But, don't we have better things to do? Like scrubbing latrines? You could pick up a copper for that.~
@178  = ~Woah-hoh! You look like me coming off a hard night. What's the matter, chief?~
@179  = ~I'm losing control, Angelo. Whatever Irenicus did to me...~
@180  = ~I'm frightened. I feel as if I'm not myself.~
@181  = ~It's nothing. After that ordeal, who wouldn't be dizzy?~
@182  = ~I'm fine, Angelo!~
@183  = ~I don't know, but thank you for your concern.~
@184  = ~I told you this was a bad idea. We could be kicking up our heels in an inn right now... forgive me, chief. Let me know if you need anything.~
@185  = ~Are you sure? I've seen you dizzy before; this is worse. Well...let me know if you need anything.~
@186  = ~There once was a rogue from the East,
Whose old friends, one by one, proved deceased,
Sought escape from the past,
And found it at last,
When his innards with whiskey were greased!~
@187  = ~Now, whoever could that be?~
@188  = ~I don't know how I feel about this. Not that I mind you chasing me round in circles, but perhaps the next time, you could give fair warning so I could get a head start?~
@189  = ~I know this isn't your fault, chief. Let's go do something about it.~
@190  = ~What's the matter, chief? Getting the shakes? Happened all the time in the army; just sit till it passes.~
@191  = ~No, I fear it is something else. I...~
@192  = ~No, no! Get away, you've got to...~
@193  = ~RUN!~
@194  = ~What? Can't hear you, chief. Wha-~
@195  = ~Well now.~
@196  = ~Angelo, I'm scared...~
@197  = ~You wouldn't abandon me, would you? I need you now more than ever!~
@198  = ~Don't tell me you're afraid of my power.~
@199  = ~Chief--m'lady--no one likes getting chased around by a ten-foot lobster demon, but I've been through worse. Of course I wouldn't abandon you.~
@200  = ~Happen I have to, I guess I'll defend myself; but let's hope it not come to that. Gods, this is no good, is it.~
@201  = ~You see Angelo Dosan, the hardened rogue who once served as your brother's lieutenant, and has since served you more or less as he promised. Strangely, he seems unfazed by the task ahead.~
@202  = ~What means that look, chief?~
@203  = ~Angelo, thanks for all you've done, but this is not your battle. I would not blame you if you turned back now.~
@204  = ~Angelo, I would like your aid in this, but I cannot insist. Your life is your own to risk.~
@205  = ~You're not thinking of cutting and running, you coward?~
@206  = ~You say so. Well, forgive me for once if I observe you're lying. You'll need my help, make no mistake... We know each other, chief. Let's finish this.~
@207  = ~Aye, and risk it I will in any case. I'll follow you. We all owe the gods a death, and I've been skipping my debt for some time now.~
@208  = ~Thinking? Of course I am. Will I? Of course not. Bring it on, chief.~
@209  = ~<CHARNAME>... you're a better <PRO_MANWOMAN> than your brother. I've enjoyed myself fair in your company, for what it's worth.~
@210  = ~You see Angelo Dosan, the hardened rogue who once served as your brother's lieutenant, and has since served you more or less as he promised. You have grown close in ways you could not have imagined. Strangely, he seems unfazed by the task ahead.~
@211  = ~What means that look, m'lady?~
@212  = ~Angelo, I couldn't bear to see you harmed. This is my fight. Afterwards... we will meet again, I swear.~
@213  = ~Angelo, I know you would follow me, but I do not insist. If you have any doubts, I would not blame you if...~
@214  = ~I need you now, Angelo, more than ever. Will you stand by me?~
@215  = ~I'm like a bad copper, chief; you'll not be rid of me that easily. Come the hells or high water I'll stick with you.~
@216  = ~Then you'll not blame me if I stay the course?~
@217  = ~Stand by you? There's no need to ask it.~
@218  = ~You know I couldn't forgive myself if I left you now. I don't know what I was looking for when I sought you out, but I've found something worth more than my life. As for what happens... well. Gods only know the way it's going to be, chief.~
@219  = ~Well, chief, I couldn't help feeling sorry for your predicament; so while you were sleeping, I did some looking around... and you'll never guess who turned up!~ [adang101]

@243  = ~Well, it was a matter of time.~ [adang151]
@244  = ~You didn't mention anything about bounty hunters, Angelo!~
@245  = ~What can the Fist do in Amnish territory?~
@246  = ~Another reason for seeking out my company?~
@247  = ~Chief, I believe it to have been implicit. I said, after all, I was a wanted man.~
@248  = ~Legally, nothing. But I was of the Fist, chief. This sod here is what you call an 'independent contractor;' I was myself in the day. The Fist would never let a simple thing like laws interfere with justice, and it's not just men of my stripe who are responsible. I know Scar for one didn't like it, but he's dead.~
@249  = ~A quarter the work they do is carried out like this, I'd estimate. And yes before you ask, we can expect more... but they'll be no match for you.~
@250  = ~Would I lie to you, chief? Of course. Now this, I could handle myself, but I can't be awake all the time... and neither can you. So you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.~
@251  = ~(<CHARNAME>, might I... see that notice? Purely for curiosity's sake. The prudent man leaves all options open, yes?)~
@252  = ~Thanks, chief.~ [adang000]
@253  = ~I'm starting to get tired of this.~
@254  = ~Hmph.~
@255  = ~No problem, Angelo.~
@256  = ~Whyever? The robes of these worthies should sell for a gold or two. Take heart, <CHARNAME>.~
@257  = ~Halt! Sir Angelo Dosan!~
@258  = ~Oh, gods.~
@259  = ~I have a sinking feeling I know what this is about.~
@260  = ~Angelo, this is the very last time, I swear!~
@261  = ~What do you want, Des?~ [adang152]
@262  = ~You remember me, do you? Then you remember your honor, the sacred oath of the guard you spit on when you betrayed our city into the hands of foreign madmen?~
@263  = ~Des... I never betrayed you. I was working with them from the start.~
@264  = ~Then you swore the oath itself in bad conscience! Angelo Dosan, I hereby place you under arrest for high treason. The penalty will most certainly be death.~
@265  = ~Do you mean to tell me you never took a bribe or two?~
@266  = ~That is not the issue! How many died because of your crimes?~
@267  = ~How many die of hunger in the Gate each day? Des, you have no right to sanction me, you know naught of me; and more to the point, you have no right to arrest me here. You're an honest man. I never expected to see you in with these scoundrels.~
@268  = ~Then I shall see you dead at my feet.~
@269  = ~He was a good man.~ [adang153]

@274  = ~What for? This is what happens to good men. Let's be on our way, <CHARNAME>.~
@275  = ~I think Des had made captain. Losing him ought to take the spirit out of them... How much can they afford to waste on chasing a dog like me?~
@276  = ~Halt! You there! <CHARNAME>, you've made quite a name for yourself in this city, but don't think you're above the law yet. I have a warrant for the arrest of a man matching the description of one of your hangers-on.~
@277  = ~Ach, bloody 'ell.~
@278  = ~I had thought I deposited quite enough gold into the hands of your associates, fool!~
@279  = ~You must be mistaken. I am merely a young maid with a curious accent and quite delicate skin, so that I must wear my hood low...~
@280  = ~That emerald was a willing gift from the merchant's daughter, I swear it, berk.~
@281  = ~Sir, are you Ruskin Hawkes?~
@282  = ~For once, I'm afraid you really are mistaken. There is no one by that name in my... ~
@283  = ~We don't harbor the man you seek.~
@284  = ~Ruskin Hawkes?~
@285  = ~Ahem.~
@286  = ~Sir Hawkes, your name appeared in documents belonging to the late maleficent Horace Blackthorne. Whether he knew you in his capacity as an extortionist, murderer or forger, I am afraid I will have to take you in.~
@287  = ~Oh, gods. Will a few hundred gold smooth this over, Amarant? Or perhaps the promise of great <CHARNAME>'s goodwill?~
@288  = ~It most certainly shall not. If you are innocent, you have nothing to fear.~
@289  = ~Like bees to sweet honey, is trouble to this man.~

@294  = ~(Don't say my name! You heard this worthy, I'm Ruskin Hawkes. At least, according to my papers so lovingly prepared by our late friend Blackthorne, I am. This is small potatoes, but if they find out who I really am... )~
@295  = ~I'm not so sure. What's in it for me?~
@296  = ~Of course, I'll do what I can. I have no more love for the law than you.~
@297  = ~I'll do what I can, Angelo; I still need your help.~
@298  = ~If you caused Sarevok this much trouble, I can't believe you're still alive.~
@299  = ~I hope you're joking, chief.~
@300  = ~That's good to hear, chief. You won't regret this.~
@301  = ~With Sarevok I was FIRMLY on the wrong side of the law. Please, wrack your brains here...~
@302  = ~The charge is guilt by association in major criminal activity. Your friend shall be held in the municipal prison until such time as his guilt is ascertained. Bail will be set at two hundred and fifty gold.~
@303  = ~<CHARNAME>, I suppose we should do something; although a part of me would fain otherwise.~
@304  = ~He's a bastard, but we can't just let him hang. Then we'd be no better than him.~
@305  = ~Ah, another innocent victim of a tragic miscarriage of justice, although I doubt any turnips were involved.~
@306  = ~But... what about me! I assure you, I am many times more wicked and powerful than this lackwit you have just dragged away!~
@307  = ~Angelo is not Angelo? Minsc does not understand this, but surely some wrong has been done here! <CHARNAME>, to the rescue!~
@308  = ~Sir Hawkes, follow me.~
@309  = ~... quite sufficient. And the charges will be dropped, then?~ [adangS04]
@310  = ~Oh... must assuredly... Officer... Amarant, sir...~
@311  = ~At ease. You are an officer of superlative quality.~
@312  = ~Thank... you... sir...~
@313  = ~Now, my brother, let us be off.~ [adangS05]
@314  = ~What's going on here!?~
@315  = ~Who the hell are you?~
@316  = ~Angelo, explain yourself, please.~
@317  = ~Ah. My brother, are these the companions you spoke of? Truly, what auspicious timing. I have been most eager to make your acquaintance.~ [adangS06]
@318  = ~<CHARNAME>, at your service.~
@319  = ~Hang on, nobody's going anywhere until I get an explanation.~
@320  = ~Why?~
@321  = ~I am greatly honored by this meeting, <CHARNAME>. In the short time since we have been so happily re-acquainted, my brother Dosan has told me much of your qualities.~
@322  = ~You never told me you had a brother, Angelo. He doesn't look much like you.~
@323  = ~Your... brother? What IS going on?~
@324  = ~It's, ah... manner of speaking, chief. He's no blood of mine. That's just how... certain people, in a certain profession... how we used to call each other.~ [adang155]
@325  = ~<CHARNAME>, ah... this is an old friend, Amato Sawara. From Kozakura. Damned if I know what he's doing so far from home, but then, here I am. I told him you had it under control, but he insisted on helping me out, so...~
@326  = ~Oh, believe me very much, it was my greatest pleasure to so assist an old companion. In the days of my youngness, Dosan my brother was very close to my heart.~
@327  = ~He, ah, was just a kid when I knew him last. Must be about twenty now, and it looks like he's got a few talents of the sorcerous kind. Eh, kid?~
@328  = ~I have known men of this kind, <CHARNAME>. Tread carefully.~
@329  = ~My brother, while I am much charmed by this familiar mode of address, perhaps for the sake of propriety it would interest you to know something... but, this is hardly the time or place for such exchange of pleasantries. Allow me to extend an offer of invitation. If all of you my friends would do me the honor of allowing me to entertain you at my current place of residence... ?~
@330  = ~This is terrific, but I'm not sure we have time. Angelo?~
@331  = ~I thank you kindly, and for your help, and will certainly visit you.~
@332  = ~Hang on, chief; let's see what he has to say.~
@333  = ~This is most excellent. Allow me, then, to direct you. When you go to the district of the great bridge, you will find one of my friends; a small, white friend. Speak to him my word, 'Kitsunegari,' and he will faithfully lead you to my home.~
@334  = ~Now I respectfully bid you... "fare-well," as you say?~ [adangS07]
@335  = ~Out of the frying-pan and into the fire.~ [adang000]
@336  = ~What's the matter, Angelo, wasn't he your friend?~
@337  = ~I'm listening.~
@338  = ~Like I said, when I saw him last, I was on furlough. He was a tousle-headed kid and I gave him what I thought was his first dagger. But just now? When he said there was something I should know?~
@339  = ~I doubt you noticed, but he pulled on his collar, and there was Black Lizard ink right up to his chin. Not only does that mean he's with them, but with ink like that he must be a captain at least, if not the very grandmaster.~
@340  = ~And so, further down the burrow. Caution, <CHARNAME>.~
@341  = ~I thought he was kind of cute. He can't really be a criminal, can he?~
@342  = ~Something's amiss here, isn't it? And he never did explain what he was doing here. Still, why don't we take him up on his invitation.~
@343  = ~Right. Join me, and we'll explore this mystery further.~
@344  = ~I am sorry, Angelo - wait here, please. I have no room for you at the moment.~
@345  = ~Sure thing, chief.~
@346  = ~If that's how you feel, chief.~
@347  = ~I may come back later.~
@348  = ~It won't be long, I promise.~
@349  = ~The fox looks at you and turns away.~
@350  = ~The fox stares at you.~
@351  = ~Kitsunegari.~
@352  = ~(say nothing)~
@353  = ~The fox trots onwards. It seems it is waiting for you to follow.~
@354  = ~This gem is cold and dead. You cannot use it again.~
@355  = ~The gem sparkles and spins under your fingers. Somehow you know it can take you back to Athkatla, but you will not be able to return.~
@356  = ~I want to go back.~
@357  = ~I am not ready yet.~
@358  = ~The gem flashes, and you feel incredibly light as the floor gives way.~
@359  = ~Welcome, welcome, my friends! My brother! Truly this is an auspicious day. You must make yourselves at home, and we must all be friends.~ [adangS03]
@360  = ~Sawara, I have to apologize. I see you've come up in the world since we last met.~ [adang156]
@361  = ~How typically perceptive of you, my brother. I will not speak much of this, however, it is of no importance. Rather we should all be as equals.~
@362  = ~Woah-hoh, this is some abode you've got here! Pretty carpets, a handsome man and a pretty girl! What more could a fellow want?~
@363  = ~...~
@364  = ~Good evening, my lord.~
@365  = ~Please, put yourself at ease, enjoy. Speak to me later and perhaps there will be more matter to discuss. You can leave and re-enter by speaking to the fox, at any time.~
@366  = ~(Chief, you see him as I do. Pretty words, but a cold fish, like your brother. And he'll hate me as a traitor because I left. I don't think he's here to kill me, or he'd have done it already; but if he wants to deal, expect him to turn. And we'd do well to even the odds somehow before then.)~
@367  = ~...~ [adang000]
@368  = ~Hello, my name is <CHARNAME>.~
@369  = ~Who are you?~
@370  = ~What is your name?~
@371  = ~Not very talkative, are you?~
@372  = ~Never mind.~
@373  = ~All right, never mind.~
@374  = ~I have nothing to say.~
@375  = ~Tell me about yourself.~
@376  = ~What do you think of Sawara?~
@377  = ~Is that all?~
@378  = ~What do you think of Suu?~
@379  = ~Farewell.~
@380  = ~My name is Hayate. As a fighter I have no peer. If you care to test that, come speak to me, but I have no use for other words.~
@381  = ~A braggart, eh? The louder they boast, the louder they beg for mercy.~
@382  = ~Don't needle him, chief. The name's familiar. From what I've heard, he can back up that claim.~
@383  = ~Sawara is my master. I owe him my life and will follow him wherever he goes.~
@384  = ~A meddlesome whore. I have no use for women. My strength alone is enough to protect my master.~
@385  = ~I like you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. When the time comes, I'll favor you. I will say nothing more.~
@386  = ~Good evening, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@387  = ~Good evening.~
@388  = ~Here are your star sapphires.~
@389  = ~I'm but a simple courtesan, <PRO_LADYLORD>. I am well-versed in the art of pleasing men, and women, for that matter.~
@390  = ~You're rather up-front about that.~
@391  = ~You're not fooling anyone, I can see those muscles.~
@392  = ~In that case, perhaps we could...~
@393  = ~I've found there's little use for coyness in this trade, <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@394  = ~The better to please you with, <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@395  = ~My master's hospitality does not extend that far, I'm afraid.~
@396  = ~I have lived in Amn for several years now. It was I who... gave Sawara cause to be here, by certain reports.~
@397  = ~Come on. Be honest.~
@398  = ~What does Sawara want in Amn?~
@399  = ~What do you think of Hayate?~
@400  = ~Thank you. Farewell.~
@401  = ~That is my master's business, <PRO_LADYLORD>, and hardly mine.~
@402  = ~He is my master.~
@403  = ~Master Hayate is a swordsman of peerless ability.~
@404  = ~Very well. You want honesty? Perhaps I could use a touch of honesty in this damned cage of lies. I'm a killer, the best, and I've been slitting throats for Sawara since he was fourteen summers and I was twelve.~
@405  = ~What do I think of Sawara? He's a cold, beautiful, heartless devil. He stole my heart when I was a girl and ground it under his heel, and now he's taken up with that wooden post over there.~
@406  = ~Are you implying that Sawara and Hayate are lovers?~
@407  = ~What a rake!~
@408  = ~Hayate!?~
@409  = ~It's some grand old tradition of "the mirror of male love." Hells, I wouldn't care if he took us both; I only want him, I don't care what else; but now he has no eyes for me anymore.~
@410  = ~Some days I wonder if I should turn my blade on myself. Are you satisfied?~
@411  = ~Tough luck, sister.~
@412  = ~I know where this is heading, too. You think because of my wounded maiden's heart I'll betray him, don't you? I can already tell there will be bad business betwixt you. Well, I may be a whore, but you'll find I'm not bought for a song.~
@413  = ~What can buy your loyalty, then?~
@414  = ~Is there something else I can do for you?~
@415  = ~Then, goodbye.~
@416  = ~Well, now.~
@417  = ~There is one thing my heart desires. I would dearly like a pair of star sapphires, to make earrings. Earrings like my big sister had, years ago. They are lost, but these would remind me of her.~
@418  = ~I would be very grateful to anyone who could bring them to me. Very grateful indeed. I will say nothing more.~
@419  = ~Then you shall have your jewels. Farewell.~
@420  = ~Star sapphires? Good luck with that.~
@421  = ~Is there nothing I can do to change your mind, my lady?~
@422  = ~My lady, is it? Hmph. No one's called me that in a while.~
@423  = ~Look, you're going to think I'm pitiful, but will you listen a minute? I was trained from when I could talk, by the old grandmaster Sawara usurped, to do two things; kill men and pleasure them. I enjoyed both. Now, with the weeks we've been holed up here, I haven't so much looked at a handsome man in as many. Laugh if you want, but I've enjoyed our talk. It made me feel like I was more than a quick dagger.~
@424  = ~I like you, m'lord. When the time comes, I'll favor you. I will say nothing more.~
@425  = ~I am ever so grateful. When the time comes, I'll favor you. I will say nothing more.~
@426  = ~My friend! My brother!~ [adangS03]
@427  = ~You said you had some "matter" to discuss?~
@428  = ~Tell me, what brings you to Amn?~
@429  = ~How do you know Angelo?~
@430  = ~I've changed my mind, I'll run your errand.~
@431  = ~A most delicate piece of business, but more of this later.~
@432  = ~You have met my friend Hayate? I am extremely fond of him. As I see you have followers yourself, I trust you know how difficult it is to find those who are both reliable and agreeable. I find Hayate-dono to be both. Perhaps you now think the same of my brother?~
@433  = ~Suu is a sweet girl, greatly accommodating. Generally. Sometimes she grows restless, she complains of bad treatment that is not real. I place trust in her, but ultimately she is perhaps too... "mercurial" for my liking.~
@434  = ~I would not like to betray your brother's confidence by telling you anything that he has not told you himself. Suffice to say we share memories of certain friends, certain places, and a certain way of life. He was a man of my father's generation, and my father thought highly of him.~
@435  = ~Of course, we were all dismayed at his decision to take his leave of us, but much time has passed since then. The offense itself was quickly forgotten. I was only a boy when it happened, and I know little of it, really.~
@436  = ~Ah yes. It is such a shame to mar our pleasures with business activities, but perhaps it is time to introduce this matter. I would not want to make waste of your time.~
@437  = ~I have a request I would make of you, but it is a request of my heart; that is, delicate. First I would see merely, in a friendly manner, if my brother Angelo is yet the man I once knew.~ [adangS08]
@438  = ~I assure you, little brother--I mean my brother, I don't think I've changed in twoscore years.~
@439  = ~Be that as it may, think of this as a game, nothing more. Besides you stand to gain something from it. I have here a rather large package of a certain material, that a friend residing close by has requested of me. I am rather tired at the moment, and thought that perhaps you would be willing to make this delivery, as a favor.~
@440  = ~This is quite rude of me as a host, I realize. The agreed-upon price for this material was four thousand gold, and if you bring this sum back to me, I will allow you to keep five hundred. You may find my friend at Delosar Inn, and he is a man by the name of Pierre.~
@441  = ~Exactly what kind of substance are we talking about, here?~
@442  = ~It's a deal.~
@443  = ~I don't think I have anything to prove, but I'll do it.~
@444  = ~Forget it, I want nothing to do with this!~
@445  = ~There is a time and a place for questions. This... is not that time, nor place.~
@446  = ~Ah. Such a pleasure to meet an agreeable <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@447  = ~Of course, of course. You have my thanks.~
@448  = ~Oh, that is a shame, my friend. A very great shame. And I had such hopes for our mutual bettering. Do return to me if you should change your mind...?~
@449  = ~Ah. Such a pleasure to meet an agreeable <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@450  = ~Lotus. I can smell the reek from here, and it's a wonder the guard doesn't.~ [adang000]
@451  = ~<CHARNAME>, I should not have to tell you that it is your duty to turn this in to the authorities.~
@452  = ~We are going straight to the Chief Inspector to turn this in, I assume.~
@453  = ~I imagine that law enforcement, such as it is in this city, would have an interest in this item.~
@454  = ~We've dealt. Now let's to the Chief Inspector without delay.~
@455  = ~The lotus trade is a plague on the poor, offering empty dreams. But if we could turn this in to the proper authorities...~
@456  = ~Toys from children. I sense a business proposition afoot, if your dull wits can but apprehend it. Perhaps a certain old friend of mine would have an interest in this merchandise...?~
@457  = ~Ach. Split the profits w' him? Why nae just sell ye whole bloody lot n' keep the gold? There's thieves in this city 'd pay a mint, ah reckon.~
@458  = ~Five hundred to us, three thousand five hundred to him, hmm? I think that other parties might offer us better arithmetic.~
@459  = ~What is he thinking working like this, moving such a chunk through amateurs? He can't be getting sloppy.~
@460  = ~H-h-hello. Friend. Got the shakes, got the shakes bad, see.~
@461  = ~Oh, gods, I've seen this one time too many.~
@462  = ~Can you cure me? Can you cure me, friend?~
@463  = ~I have a delivery for you...~
@464  = ~I could 'cure' you, but not by giving you this.~
@465  = ~Tell me about yourself. I have to make sure you're the man.~
@466  = ~P-P-Pierre. I make the music. Beautiful music. But to make the music I need a pinch of, of, of. Uh, uh, uh. Hey friend, can you cure me?~
@467  = ~Here you go, Pierre.~
@468  = ~Didn't you have the music before, Pierre? Think hard about this. This isn't your cure. Sit here and calm down and maybe the music will come back to you. Or go to a temple or a house of healing.~
@469  = ~No, I'm not giving you this.~
@470  = ~H-h-here it is. Oh, oh, oh.~
@471  = ~We can always make use of another gold coin, I suppose, but this is most unseemly.~
@472  = ~That poor man, can't you see he's sick! <CHARNAME>, how could you?~
@473  = ~That was a loathsome action, <CHARNAME>.~
@474  = ~I want to get to the bottom of this, but there had to have been a better way to do it.~
@475  = ~By Helm, I never knew a man could sink so low. I do not know if I mean him or you, <CHARNAME>.~
@476  = ~Th-thank you.~
@477  = ~C-c'cmon, come, come on, I need, I need I... ~
@478  = ~Then, here you go.~
@479  = ~I can't give you this is good conscience, Pierre. You have to turn your life around. Aren't you a bard?~
@480  = ~But to get the music I need the cure, the cure! Can you cure me, friend?~
@481  = ~I can. Take this.~
@482  = ~Y-y-you're...~
@483  = ~Gods, man, pray! Pray to whatever your god to cure you of this terrible affliction! I will pray to Torm for aid on your behalf. This is not your cure, it is a demon feasting on your very soul.~
@484  = ~You're right. Got to think, got to think. Don't need the cure, need the music.~
@485  = ~I've known. They all told me.~
@486  = ~I... thank you. I will try. I wasn't always as you s-s-see me now. Take the gold, keep it; I d-don't need it either. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. I'll write a song for you; I'll overc-come this. Thank you.~
@487  = ~I have something you may be interested in...~
@488  = ~By me dam's name, such a quantity! I won't ask where you came by this. Thank you, friend, you've done a great service for the city. Taking such a lot off the streets will help us in our fight. You've earned this reward.~
@489  = ~Well, well, well. I'm impressed; this is fine quality. Bold of you to carry it straight here, too. Still, I can offer you no more than three thousand gold; still a princely sum.~
@490  = ~Yes, I agree.~
@491  = ~No, I cannot agree.~
@492  = ~Pleasure doing business with you.~
@493  = ~Aye? Well, come back straight if you change your mind. My offer won't sit forever.~
@494  = ~Ah, my friend, my brothers. Useless, after all. My sincere apologies, but I will have to take your lives. Please try not to struggle too much, you will make this difficult for us all.~ [adangS03]
@495  = ~Well, that's an end to that. Powerful bugger he'd become, but no match for you, chief. Still, I can't help but feel there was more to it.~ [adang000]
@496  = ~I brought the money.~
@497  = ~I'd like to know more about your organization.~
@498  = ~I have nothing to tell you at the moment.~
@499  = ~I would not like to betray your brother's confidence by telling you anything that he has not told you himself. Suffice to say we share memories of certain friends, certain places, and a certain way of life. He was a man of my father's generation, and my father thought highly of him.~
@500  = ~Ah, my friend, I would like to open my heart to you; but you understand there is only so much I can tell you. It is a matter of propriety. It is--suffice?--to say that we represent a number of business concerns in Kozakura. We help to keep order and happiness in society. The men of the law respect us, and we likewise them. There are five large clans that trace their lineage many years back, the Mountain Cat, the Scorpion, the Peach Blossom, the Fighting Carp and the Black Lizard--mine, and my brother's. Does this...satisfy?~
@501  = ~You speak as if Angelo were still one of you.~
@502  = ~Angelo suggested you were of some importance?~
@503  = ~In other words, you're common criminals.~
@504  = ~He wears the ink. Until he can jump out of his skin... but this is hardly to the matter.~
@505  = ~Oh, it is hardly fit to speak of such things. What importance I have is doubtless to the credit of the gods and of fortune, nothing more.~
@506  = ~Now, my friend. There is no need for such words.~
@507  = ~This is most excellent. I was certain you were a trustworthy person. My brother is a peerless judge of character.~
@508  = ~Hah.~
@509  = ~Now, to the matter. No doubt you have been wondering what brings me, a man of Kara-Tur, to this foreign city. While I find it a wonderful place, I must confess I had a specific motive; and it has never been my intention to conceal anything from you.~ [adangS09]
@510  = ~The matter is a crime that has been perpetrated against my blood, my gods and my nation. Kara-Tur is a nation, no doubt like your own, with great history and tradition and many sacred artifacts; and one such is the blade wielded by the sword saint Kashiraga Toranosuke, when he single-handedly turned the tide at the battle of Ura-no-Hitte. This blade was imbued with the spirits of four great gods, and is a precious artifact.~ [adangS10]
@511  = ~A year ago it happened that a gang of contemptible thieves, calling themselves... "archaeologists?"... dug up the tomb of Kashiraga Toranosuke quite without giving notice to our nation, and removed the sword. For many months I went in search of it. Recently my dear friend Suu made it known to me that it had surfaced, here in Athkatla, in the hands of an "art dealer" named Seline.~
@512  = ~What I ask is simple. Seline is nothing more than a common criminal. As we speak, my augury has detected that he is returning with it, along with a train, to his abode in your government district, after showing it off to one of his foppish friends.~
@513  = ~Waylay him. Retrieve the sword and bring me Seline's head. He is a traitor and profaner who deserves no less than death. I place my trust in you; my brother, my friend.~
@514  = ~I'll bring you the sword, but I certainly won't kill an innocent man!~
@515  = ~It's done. I hope the reward will be substantial.~
@516  = ~Why can't you just do it yourself?~
@517  = ~Forget it, this is beneath me.~
@518  = ~Seline is no innocent, I have told you. I will accept nothing less than both sword and head; but for the both, I will pay you no less than eight thousand gold. It is nearly all the money I have with me.~
@519  = ~I will pay you no less than eight thousand gold. It is nearly all the money I have with me.~
@520  = ~It is the way of my kind to keep to the shadows, to work only through... "middlemen?" I suspect you are familiar with this idea. I am also pleased to entrust this task to my brother, whose arrival here was most auspicious.~
@521  = ~I'm flattered.~
@522  = ~I will pay you no less than eight thousand gold. It is nearly all the money I have with me. I will pay you no less, &etc. If you truly consider this beneath you, then I suppose we have nothing more to say to each other.~
@523  = ~Koros, koros! Death to profaners of the holy gods!~
@524  = ~That young man doesn't sound like himself. Chief?~
@525  = ~Perhaps the gods have meted out their own punishment, Torm save the man.~
@526  = ~I sense foul magic here. If you retrieve that blade, I'd not draw it if I were you.~
@527  = ~The blade wields the man! Oh, what unnaturalness have we become involved in?~
@528  = ~A textbook case of possession. Need I tell you that we should proceed carefully?~
@529  = ~Chief. Listen here, if you ever listened. This hunk of steel is worth a lot more than even eight thousand gold. I'd venture to say it's priceless. I say we keep it. Don't even go back to "little brother"--he can't move from his magic hole but we'll set the guard on him. I think he's lost this one.~ [adang000]
@530  = ~Hmm. I will strongly consider this.~
@531  = ~You heard him, Angelo, he just wants to return it to his nation. It's your nation too, right?~
@532  = ~I made a deal and I intend to keep my word.~
@533  = ~I mean right by you, chief.~
@534  = ~First of all, I'm a half-breed. Even if I weren't, I doubt he could make any patriotic claims on me. Let's keep the sword, chief.~
@535  = ~Then on your own head be it.~
@536  = ~Oh wonderful! Oh excellent! Friend, if I could sing, then I would sing my joy! To have it... in my hands at last...~ [adangS11]
@537  = ~Why do I get the feeling this isn't going where I expected?~
@538  = ~You will pay me, right?~
@539  = ~You're returning it to Kara-Tur, right?~
@540  = ~What... what am I doing here?~
@541  = ~What am I doing here? What the hells have you done!~
@542  = ~I have merely expedited your return. I was... eager.~
@543  = ~Ah, rest assured. The blade shall indeed be returned to Kara-Tur, the seat of the true gods and the jewel of Toril.~
@544  = ~You swine, you filthy and degenerate Westerners, you have no conception of true beauty or life or power. This sword shall indeed be returned to my land, and it shall rule my land.~
@545  = ~I am, like my brother, the son of a concubine. But while my brother's father was in all likelihood some criminal weakling, my father was none other than his holiness the Emperor of Kozakura.~
@546  = ~Rest assured, there are perhaps a thousand such as me; and such it was always. A man such as his holiness has the permission of every woman in the kingdom, after all. We countless bastards are doomed to a life of ignominy... unless we are strong.~
@547  = ~So, will this be having an impact on our deal?~
@548  = ~Don't continue. You're going to kill me.~
@549  = ~Great. Another one.~
@550  = ~What? Worm? Are you still here? Ha! It amuses me to allow your presence in my sight for one further moment. It has been in the past that a bastard seized the throne of heaven, and why should it not be so? When I was an infant, I felt the kiss of the gods on my brow. And now at eighteen summers, I hold the criminal world of Kozakura in my hand. Soon I will hold all the kingdom likewise. With his sword... but I need a man to wield the sword.~ [adangS12]
@551  = ~Such a man as this invokes the names of the gods? Ha, ha! Amusing!~
@552  = ~Why are you looking at me, Sawara?~
@553  = ~My brother, my dear brother, why did you think I sent you on this errand? Your arrival here was pure luck, but being on the game board, I have been able to move you most adroitly.~
@554  = ~As perhaps you have realized, this blade, the Hand of the Gods, cannot be wielded by either a foreign infidel, or by a man who covets power and wishes harm to others. By this its forgers doubtless meant any who coveted THEIR power or wished THEM harm. Fools. But you, my brother, are not such a man. You are pliable. You do not crave power nor wish any man harm unless he stands in your way. In short, I have always known you had the mark of conscience upon you. You are just good enough, my brother, but not too good for my purpose.~
@555  = ~Continue with these pathetic Westerners and you will amount to nothing. But come follow me, and I, as a god, will make you as the highest and mightiest of kings.~
@556  = ~You know, Sawara, you think you're terribly novel, but I've heard that before.~
@557  = ~Does this mean we don't have a deal?~
@558  = ~This is all well and fine, but what about my reward?~
@559  = ~What did I say that sounded like "tell me your life story"?~
@560  = ~It amuses me to be magnanimous in this case. What use is mere gold to me now, the God-Emperor of Kozakura? Take your bounty and I will take the sword, and my brother will come with me and wield it in my service.~
@561  = ~I will not.~ [adang157]
@562  = ~What?~
@563  = ~I will not. All due respect, little brother, I've had enough of madmen and their grand ambitions. I'm better off with <CHARNAME>. Take your sword if you must, and we'll all leave happy.~
@564  = ~Angelo! I didn't know you cared.~
@565  = ~That's right, you had better not betray me.~
@566  = ~You know, I hate to point this out, but that's a pretty good deal he's offering you.~
@567  = ~If I'd known I could be a God-Emperor with this thing, I would have kept it.~
@568  = ~Truly? Then what say you, my worm, <CHARNAME>? ~
@569  = ~Take the sword and I'll take the gold. What you do in Kara-Tur is your business.~
@570  = ~I should warn you your ambitions will come to no good, but a deal is a deal.~
@571  = ~Having seen what you really are, I can't let this sword fall into your hands.~
@572  = ~I'm keeping the damn thing.~
@573  = ~Then I fling the coins at your feet. Gold? Why not mere dirt? Farewell, fools, weaklings, all! And you were a great fool, my brother.~ [adangS13]
@574  = ~Then you dare to challenge me?~
@575  = ~You don't know me, but I've challenged better than you in my time.~
@576  = ~I intend to spray the floor with your sermonizing guts, yes.~
@577  = ~Maybe we can just talk this over? No?~
@578  = ~I. Whom the very blood of the eight thousand Hengeyokai courses in my veins. Words, neither in my language nor yours, cannot possibly convey the absoluteness of the destruction I will visit on you! And believe me, my friend, I shall enjoy your every scream.~ [adangS14]
@579  = ~You have no love for either your land or gods; you only love yourself!~
@580  = ~A man in a familiar mould, is he not?~
@581  = ~Die.~
@582  = ~You too, you worthy? Why serve such a man as this? Both his friends and enemies end up dead.~
@583  = ~Fight.~
@584  = ~Very well, your sword against mine. It's been a time since I had a proper Kara-Turan duel.~
@585  = ~NA-MO-BAN-SHU-SHU-JAN-MO-NI-FO!
NA-MO-BAN-SHU-SHU-JAN-MO-NI-FO!

LI-PO-LI-PO-DI!
CHIOH-HE-CHIOH-HE-DI!

Spirits of fire, spirits of frost, appear!
Spirits of death, spirits of birth, I charge you appear.~ [adangS15]
@586  = ~Sorry, "my master," you're on your own.~
@587  = ~What means this, girl?~
@588  = ~I mean exactly what I say. I won't become an Emperor's lackey and dog, I'll find a man who loves me.~
@589  = ~This is not altogether unexpected. But even for the sake of all we have shared, your wicked woman's heart cannot be swayed?~
@590  = ~That was a long time ago. You changed, Ama-tan; and so have I.~
@591  = ~Then die with the others, you tiny blot on the face of my kingdom.~
@592  = ~Good evening, <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@593  = ~I'm sorry, it had to be done. He wouldn't listen to reason.~
@594  = ~Thanks, I owe you one.~
@595  = ~You could have joined in on my side, you know.~
@596  = ~Surely you jest. You knew this would end in violence, didn't you?~
@597  = ~On the contrary...~
@598  = ~Oh, I knew you were a match for him. He always did think too highly of himself. A man gets stronger and stronger and suddenly his self-opinion just takes wings and flies off.~
@599  = ~I am now the happiest girl in either Amn or Kara-Tur. The ingrate is dead at my feet, and by right of succession, I am now the grandmaster of the Black Lizard clan.~
@600  = ~A part of me feels heavy... but it will pass. I felt the same way when I first killed a man. Rungs on a ladder we all must climb... he used to say.~
@601  = ~Fare you well, then.~
@602  = ~Farewell, handsome. It's a shame we couldn't get to know each other better, but I'm sure you have work to do, and I have a power vacuum to fill. But come and visit me in Kozakura sometime; your friend will lead you there. I'm sure you'll find us most... hospitable.~
@603  = ~Farewell, handsome. You've lived to be old, so you must be smarter than Ama-tan. I never knew you, but you're a good one as far as I'm concerned.~
@604  = ~Say. When you've had it with these Westerners, why not visit me in Kozakura? I'm sure you remember our hospitality. In point of fact, I'd be happy to... entertain you myself.~
@605  = ~I'm waiting, Angelo, and it had better be good.~
@606  = ~You're not going to take her up on that, are you?~
@607  = ~Don't worry, <CHARNAME>, I won't.~
@608  = ~A familiar story. It sometimes makes you think the gods rule our lives, after all, when patterns surface time and again.~ [adang000]
@609  = ~Or more likely it's merely our mechanical stupidity, grinding and grinding in the same groove.~ [adang158]
@610  = ~Let's go, chief.~ [adang159]
@611  = ~How are you feeling, Angelo?~
@612  = ~Right.~
@613  = ~You really are a strange one, <CHARNAME>. I can't imagine your brother asking that. Suffice to say I'm not happy. He was young, and while he brought it on his own head, I can't but wish he'd had better.~
@614  = ~Ho there, travelers, stay a moment!~
@615  = ~I'm tired, I'm wounded, I haven't really the time...~
@616  = ~You know, you remind me of another old man I once met.~
@617  = ~Alright, alright. What do you want?~
@618  = ~Angelo Dosan?~
@619  = ~How the hells do you know my name? Nevermind. Nothing surprises me anymore.~
@620  = ~Angelo Dosan, I call on you on behalf of all the eight million gods, of your ancestors and the fate of your soul.~
@621  = ~Who the devil are you, old coot? Wait.~
@622  = ~I know your kind. The Imperial Police, isn't it? Well, I must say I'm honored; I never thought I'd merit your attention. I know the more weak and worthless your agents look, the stronger they are.~
@623  = ~Heh-hee. Most wise, my boy. Yes, my name is Ginpachi, and I come hence under the auspices of none less than his holiness the Emperor; and I invoke his name as well.~
@624  = ~Invoke it in what, old man?~
@625  = ~You know well enough. You must return the blade. I have been watching Sawara for some time, and knew he meant no good; plague as he was on our homes, his presence abroad forecasted even worse. But now he is dead, and the blade is in more temperate hands. Will you fulfill your honor and return it?~
@626  = ~So it can be placed alongside all the other "national treasures" in the Emperor's palace? The damned codger has enough treasure already.~
@627  = ~Heh, hee, but you oughtn't to speak like that. 'Tis blasphemy. You are a man without honor or country, for which I will not judge you; you judge yourself. But I know more than I seem to know, and I know that your life is not your own to command. What says your master?~
@628  = ~Well. Chief?~
@629  = ~Give the sword back, Angelo. It's the right thing to do.~
@630  = ~I can't make up your mind for you.~
@631  = ~You're right, why give this to someone you've never met? The Emperor has no claim on you.~
@632  = ~We need that sword, Angelo; don't you dare return it.~
@633  = ~A disappointing end to a sour adventure. The whole things leaves a bad taste in my mouth, <CHARNAME>. Sawara might have been mad, but the Emperor and his father and his father before him have been grinding the people of Kozakura into the dirt for millennia.~
@634  = ~Wealth combined with mysticism! This is precisely the mechanism used by the ruling classes to keep the greater part of the population in ignorance and poverty!~
@635  = ~I suppose the right has been upheld, although I confess I did not like the look of that man, either.~
@636  = ~Ah, the same law, all Toril over. Snatching old mystical blades out of the hands of innocent bystanders.~
@637  = ~I am pleased in this. Balance, and sacred order, has been upheld.~
@638  = ~Have you lost your mind entirely? No... that implies there was some such article to be lost, I suppose.~
@639  = ~Heh, heh! My thanks. You are a most sagacious person, my friend. We shall not meet again.~
@640  = ~Sawara might have been mad, but the Emperor and his father and his father before him have been grinding the people of Kozakura into the dirt for millennia. You will not have it.~
@641  = ~Hee-hee. What did that old man know, anyway?~
@642  = ~Right! Let him choke on it; he has enough.~
@643  = ~Aw, aye! We dinnae owe him to spit on 'im, eh?~
@644  = ~That blade brought death to its previous owner. Do you truly wish it in our hands, <CHARNAME>?~
@645  = ~Hee-hee-hee! I expected no less. So be it, then. Make use of it... while it is yours.~
@646  = ~I'll be blunt. I don't like the way that Drow looked at you.~ [adang805]
@647  = ~What? Solaufein!?~
@648  = ~Mmm, do you mean that darling Solaufein?~
@649  = ~I hope you're not turning jealous on me.~
@650  = ~Was that his name? Hmph.~
@651  = ~Don't get me wrong, <CHARNAME>. Happen I... like it when you get the odd appreciative glance. If you know what I mean. But as I said, I like not this.~
@652  = ~Don't forget yourself now, m'lady. For aught he knows, you're a powerful woman Drow, and a damned beautiful one at that. That is to say, I'd hardly blame the sod.~
@653  = ~It's all in your head, Angelo.~
@654  = ~But Solaufein is canny. He knows his place.~
@655  = ~Mm-hmm. I am indeed, aren't I?~
@656  = ~You are such a hypocrite!~
@657  = ~It takes one to know one, chief.~
@658  = ~Aye, mayhap...~
@659  = ~The finest drow I ever set eyes on, but you see my point?~
@660  = ~Well, I've been called worse, <CHARNAME>.~
@661  = ~A man like that is serious. When he gets a glint in his eye, you can bet good money it means something. Tread warily, that's all I'm saying.~
@662  = ~I still think you are imaging this.~
@663  = ~What have you got against him, Angelo?~
@664  = ~This discussion is over!~
@665  = ~I hope you're right, m'lady.~
@666  = ~As a man? Nothing.~
@667  = ~But I'd not care to fight him on the field of battle or love, his eyes all smoldering with dark passion. Whispering sweet nothings in the ear of some poor up-worlder. Oh gods, it just isn't fair, why did all the graces of love seep down through the soil and infect these damned wicked elves?~
@668  = ~Well, now. Perhaps you'll have to try a bit harder, hmm?~
@669  = ~Don't worry, Angelo. You're the one I love.~
@670  = ~You are starting to sound like a racist.~
@671  = ~If that's what it takes, m'lady.~
@672  = ~(sigh) It's good to hear that, m'lady. Let's, ah, forget about this whole incident.~
@673  = ~Chief, I don't hold aught against the Drow for being cruel or shrewd or letting their women run the show. I just don't see why on top of that, the gods couldn't have made them properly ugly.~
@674  = ~Legs. Legs, chief. I can't deal with it. There's only so many legs an honest creature should have.~ [adang102]
@675  = ~You have got to be kidding me.~
@676  = ~An-ge-lo's a chi-cken, An-ge-lo's a chi-cken!~
@677  = ~I know exactly what you mean.~
@678  = ~Just so you understand, this never happened.~
@679  = ~Chief, do we have to do this?~ [adang000]
@680  = ~Don't tell me you're scared of the undead, Angelo.~
@681  = ~Yes.~
@682  = ~Well, if you like, we could just hang up our swords and go pick daisies.~
@683  = ~I'm not scared of anything that breathes. But how are you supposed to kill something that's already dead?~
@684  = ~Woah-ho, ho, ho! Look who comes here, as if he owned the world! It seems you've had a pleasure even I can't claim, chief. So...do tell, what are these dark-skinned dams like twixt the sheets?~ [adang000]
@685  = ~It was nothing to write home about.~
@686  = ~A gentlemen never tells, Angelo.~
@687  = ~Well, she... and then...~
@688  = ~In all honesty, it was rather frightening...~
@689  = ~Let's just say that book you gave me proved of value.~
@690  = ~That being the case, chief, are you certain the lady was to blame?~
@691  = ~Heh-heh, fair enough!~
@692  = ~Oh-oh! And then... with her... ? Lucky man! Still, it's nothing your properly-trained Kara-Turan lass couldn't manage.~
@693  = ~Ah-heh, heh heh!~
@694  = ~Heh-heh! I've done good by you chief, eh?~
@695  = ~The next time, ask if she's got a sister, eh?~
@696  = ~Chief, you know I hate to bother you in the middle of all this, but I have one question.~ [adang103]
@697  = ~Of course, what sort of leader would I be if I didn't listen to my men?~
@698  = ~Very well, say on.~
@699  = ~Not right now, Angelo.~
@700  = ~You, ah... you were going around the Gate picking up sword-arms, I know. Did you happen to run into a girl, young lady I mean, name of Shar-Teel? I'd heard she was doing sword work around Beregost way, the last.~
@701  = ~I'm sorry, Angelo, I never met such a person.~
@702  = ~That psychotic amazon? I "met" her but she wanted to fight one of my "males," so I said no thanks.~
@703  = ~Yes, I heard her name, or I met her briefly, but I remember little.~
@704  = ~Why, yes, in fact. We traveled together a while.~
@705  = ~Why, yes. She should be pushing up daisies "around Beregost way" right now.~
@706  = ~Why, yes, indeed. We spent a night together, as I recall.~
@707  = ~Yes. We were lovers for a time.~
@708  = ~I... see. I confess that's not what I expected. I... hope you did right by her, chief.~
@709  = ~You are angry, Angelo, don't try to hide it. What's the matter?~
@710  = ~Hey, now! What did I say?~
@711  = ~Oh, she "did right" by me, I can tell you that!~
@712  = ~Of course, Angelo, I am an honorable man. Why do you ask?~
@713  = ~Is that so? Well, it was a long shot. Sorry to trouble you, chief.~
@714  = ~Why do you ask? Did you know her?~
@715  = ~Come on, out with it! You're hiding something!~
@716  = ~Glad I could satisfy your curiosity. Can we move on now?~
@717  = ~Is that so? Ah... mind if I ask, if you know what became of her? Where she is now? I'm... only curious.~
@718  = ~I'm afraid she's dead, Angelo. We had... disagreements.~
@719  = ~I'm afraid she's dead, Angelo. There was nothing I could do.~
@720  = ~No, I'm afraid I don't know.~
@721  = ~I'm sure she's out there somewhere, up to her old tricks.~
@722  = ~Truly? I... thank you for telling me, <CHARNAME>. Though you will pardon me if I don't wholly trust the report. After all, look at my own case.~
@723  = ~Eh, chief... well. You always played on the table with me, so. She's my daughter.~
@724  = ~Whoa!~
@725  = ~I find that hard to believe, knowing you two.~
@726  = ~Now that I think about it, I'm not surprised. She always said she hated mercenaries.~
@727  = ~I see. Forgive me, then.~
@728  = ~Hee, hee. I had your daughter.~
@729  = ~Do you? It's not so surprising. Sometimes the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, sometimes it falls in another orchard.~
@730  = ~Did she? It's no surprise.~
@731  = ~Eh, how could you have known?~
@732  = ~You are the chief, chief, but I'd appreciate an end to those comments all the same.~
@733  = ~I, ah... right. Well, it happened I was in the army, we were to escort the ambassador to Waterdeep. Big trade deal. The Waterdhavian minister, old cuss, had a... pretty secretary. Eri was her name. That was that.~
@734  = ~You left her with child and abandoned her? How could you, Angelo?~
@735  = ~But you abandoned her, then?~
@736  = ~Heh heh. I know how it is.~
@737  = ~Hey! Don't get me wrong, <CHARNAME>.~
@738  = ~Woah-hoh! Big talk, little man.~
@739  = ~I stuck around as long as I could. I don't know... I can't say I loved her, knowing what happened, but I felt different. She was something special. An embassy stayed behind, to see the deal through, and I pulled some strings to land guard duty. I stayed, and when the kid was born, I looked after her.~
@740  = ~You played father, then?~

@744  = ~What changed?~
@745  = ~All good things come to an end, chief. There was border trouble, and my old captain, Esim, said he needed me. Nothing I could do. Esim was my friend, and I loved him and the girls both... and I suppose in the end, he meant more to me. We'd shed blood with each other; that means something. I left a week's pay on the dresser and snuck out one morning.~
@746  = ~I suppose I can understand. It was a difficult situation.~
@747  = ~Without even telling her!~

@754  = ~I'm sorry to hear that, chief. I can't imagine it. Little Shar? But nothing surprises me these days.~
@755  = ~Heh. Of course, chief. Well... that's good to hear. I may have let her down, but if she can take care of herself... ~
@756  = ~I'm sorry to hear that, chief; but I don't blame her.~
@757  = ~Yes, of course.~

@824  = ~Ooh, let's have it!~
@825  = ~I'll, err, go to bed now.~
@826  = ~Ah come now, chief. You know you want to. It'll make us forget... a little, that's all. I'd give my own life before I saw you take to it, but a pinch ne'er hurt anyone.~
@827  = ~Ooh! You read my mind, I've always wanted to!~
@828  = ~Well... I suppose just this once, perhaps.~
@829  = ~But could we stop there? I don't think I like this.~
@830  = ~This is completely irresponsible, Angelo! You told me you've seen what this can do.~
@831  = ~This is completely immoral, Angelo! I'm aghast, get it out of my sight!~
@832  = ~Aw, chief, come now. There never was a man so true and virtuous he never touched it. Why, even your brother gave it a try! You'll enjoy yourself, I give my word.~
@833  = ~I said no, thank you.~
@834  = ~Absolutely not!~

@863  = ~Not if I could help it. After a day's butchery, four hours' rest was all the bounty I could ask. Times you could trade your ration to get some other sod to do it, and I'd rather go hungry than sleepless.~
@864  = ~You know? M'lady? You're really something. You've got a good head on your shoulders. You'd have made a fine soldier. I knew wenches in the force, and mind you, they had to be twice as tough as the men.~

@866  = ~Wench!?~
@867  = ~And after that fine display of chauvinism, I'm going to bed.~

@869  = ~Goodnight.~
@870  = ~I thought you didn't care for ladies, Angelo.~

@872  = ~(rolling eyes) I can't imagine why.~
@873  = ~They just didn't understand you, Angelo.~
@874  = ~And you understand me? Then I can't say I understand why you're sitting beside me. But... I'm glad of it. Watch is a lonely business.~

@894  = ~No... stay.~
@895  = ~That is, if you please. It's all the same to me.~
@896  = ~Afraid of beauty? Perhaps I am. It's caused as much trouble as gold and silver, I reckon. You'd do better to be wise... but you are wise, chief. A deadly combination.~
@897  = ~As a Calimshan galley full o' gold with no guards. A maid in the bloom of her youth, so pretty and sure of herself it makes you want to weep. Men get older and older and there are always more maids, and you look back one day and realize you aren't as young as you were... ~
@898  = ~(All at once he starts forward. Before you realize what's happening, he plants an awkward kiss that barely grazes your cheek.)~

@901  = ~Goodnight, chief.~
@902  = ~<CHARNAME>, about last night. It was a mistake. I lost my head, and I apologize. Besides I was short on sleep; you understand.~ [adang105]

@904  = ~There's nothing to apologize for, Angelo.~
@905  = ~What are you talking about? If you're going to apologize, apologize for leaving me dangling!~
@906  = ~What are so afraid of, Angelo?~
@907  = ~Don't you? Good. Then let's put it behind us.~
@908  = ~Maybe not from where you're standing, but I've got to watch myself.~
@909  = ~I'm afraid of this, <CHARNAME>, I won't lie to you. Don't you know we're in a fight for our lives? This will end in tears, mark my words.~
@910  = ~I don't want to make you uncomfortable. I'll say nothing more now.~
@911  = ~All right.~

@915  = ~Pfft.~
@916  = ~I mean it. I love you.~

@924  = ~I see you aren't keeping true to your word, <CHARNAME>. I thought we said we'd put this behind us.~ [adang106]
@925  = ~Oh, but I'm trying. You just make it too difficult.~
@926  = ~I can't, Angelo.~
@927  = ~YOU said that. I just sort of nodded.~

@929  = ~Then I have nothing more to say.~
@930  = ~Stop playing coy, m'lady.~
@931  = ~Well, I can't change what I am; but you can change what you do.~

@933  = ~Then I'll be sure to extract a promise next time.~
@934  = ~This is a serious business, though you don't seem to think so. I know more of the body than the heart, <CHARNAME>, but I know enough of the heart to know the danger of it. That's why I always preferred the body.~
@935  = ~<CHARNAME>, I won't lie. You are a fine lass, among the finest I've set eyes on; and I thought you were wise, but now I question that. I will serve you and fight for you and I wish you happiness, and because I wish you happiness, I can't allow this.~
@936  = ~You are a beautiful maid with all the sterling qualities of the heavens. I'm old enough to be your father (relatively anyway), I once sought your life, I drink and gamble and stink of blood; and with this life I bathe only indifferently.~

@943  = ~Aye, fine, to a point. But as I said this is no joking matter, m'lady.~
@944  = ~Frankly, yes.~
@945  = ~What do you see in me?~
@946  = ~You are strong, but your conscience is weak. I would give you care and guidance.~

@948  = ~With arms and shoulders like that? What girl could resist?~
@949  = ~Since we traveled together you've been kind to me. I want to see that side of you.~
@950  = ~To tell you the truth... it excites me to think you once tried to kill me.~

@959  = ~You would I were your father? I doubt I'd serve better than your natural sire.~
@960  = ~Love, then? An easy excuse, what can't be spoken. I've told you what I think of that.~
@961  = ~As I thought. It's only a schoolgirl's fancy after all. I've said it a thousand times; I can't say I'm not flattered; but I'm not the man you think I am. I'm no knight.~
@962  = ~Forgive me for my sharp manner and these questions. You know I only honor you. Thank you for your patience, <CHARNAME>... perhaps we will speak more later.~
@963  = ~I can't say I like the sound of that, if you aren't joking. Speak again.~
@964  = ~Well...~
@965  = ~I mean it, Angelo. Truly.~
@966  = ~<CHARNAME>, I've been thinking. The way you... feel about me. Has it changed at all?~ [adang107]
@967  = ~I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.~
@968  = ~No.~
@969  = ~Yes. You were right, Angelo; it was a childish infatuation, nothing more.~
@970  = ~What way? I'm not about to chase you, if you mean this.~
@971  = ~I was afraid of that.~
@972  = ~I'm glad to hear it, <CHARNAME>. Forgive me.~
@973  = ~Let's be on our way.~
@974  = ~<CHARNAME>... let me tell you a story.~
@975  = ~You know I don't talk much about my army days. Even I have the manners not to regale you with blood and gore... and it was blood and gore, and dirt and fatigue. But this is a war story. May not seem like it at first, but bear with me.~
@976  = ~It's about my old captain, Fawaz Esim. Calimshan. He'd been with the mercenary corps since he was a shield-bearer of twelve. Strong, trustworthy, good-hearted man, and on the field he was like a demon with his two scimitars. That doesn't do him justice; he WAS a demon when the spirit was on him. But I once saw him take arrow fire to protect two new recruits with his body, reasoning he could take it while they couldn't.~
@977  = ~Well, he fell in love with a girl. He'd got more scars than a porpentine's lover but he was still a handsome man, and she was a pretty, pretty lass; and she loved him too. Only problem was she was the daughter of one of Sembia's merchant princes.~
@978  = ~You'd think Sembians and Calimshites would get along just fine, both loving gold as they do, but this prince--rich as the gods and powerful as a king, and even saying his name I'd be afraid he'd find me here--didn't like them any. Another strike against Esim, he was a soldier, and a mercenary at that. The prince wouldn't hear of it. So she ran away with him.~
@979  = ~There was nothing the prince could do; the army held Sembia in the palm of its hand, and they wouldn't risk civil war over a slight like this. He cursed his daughter's name and disowned her, and she went with us when we marched on the hags in the Stinking Marches. Happy ending, right?~
@980  = ~I'm guessing it wasn't.~
@981  = ~I can't imagine why not.~
@982  = ~You guess right.~
@983  = ~Then you don't know the way of the world, chief.~
@984  = ~Esim was forty-five summers, the lass was twenty. Every day he was on the field cutting down the hags' fell minions and he came back to his tent stinking of ichor. I wasn't there, but I imagine the romance of the life paled pretty quickly.~
@985  = ~Wasn't long before she took up with Esim's aid-de-camp, a smart youth her own age. It was just a fling, one night is all; but Esim, a man who never lost his head when spells were raining down on it, lost it then. He drew his scimitar and cut down both his wife and the boy; then, before me and his other lieutenant could hold him, cut his own stomach open. I've seen men die 'afore me but it was never awful as then, not even the first time; seeing his life rush out him and nothing I could do. Later they told me the lass was just ripe with his daughter.~
@986  = ~A sad tale.~
@987  = ~Sounds like she had it coming.~
@988  = ~And you don't perceive the moral?~
@989  = ~Are you implying that I'm a strumpet!~
@990  = ~I would never be unfaithful to you, Angelo.~
@991  = ~It isn't the same, Angelo. I already live this life alongside you.~
@992  = ~We're both our own people. What happened to them has nothing to do with us.~
@993  = ~No?~
@994  = ~No! And I'm not implying the girl was a strumpet, either. She was a human being.~
@995  = ~I've made many as rash a promise in my time, <CHARNAME>; but you've missed the point.~
@996  = ~True enough, but you've missed the point.~
@997  = ~Perhaps, but you've missed the point.~
@998  = ~We are all only human, or elf or dwarf or what have you. I'd never say you'd make me a cuckold, and if you did I couldn't complain; more likely I'd do as much to you. No. And now that I know you, I would never, ever raise a hand to harm you.~
@999  = ~As far as I'm concerned, Esim's story didn't even end unhappily as it might have. What if that lass had wasted away, faithful to him, year after year in her frigid and loveless bed? All for one mistake made in an instant of girlish passion and willfulness. She didn't want a new lover. She missed her father.~
@1000 = ~I hardly think that's a danger in my case, Angelo.~
@1001 = ~I'm no girl. I know my own mind.~
@1002 = ~I can see why you feel this way. Thank you for telling me.~
@1003 = ~Don't make jokes, <CHARNAME>. It was no joke watching a man I loved die at my feet, and his dead bride lying a yard away with the scream still on her face.~
@1004 = ~You're no girl, but you're no woman yet. And I'm something past a man. I don't blame you for having these fancies, but I'd warn you if you act on them.~
@1005 = ~And thank you for listening, <CHARNAME>. I only hope you remember.~
@1006 = ~<CHARNAME>, life is a story. There are great characters and lesser ones. I'm one of the lesser, and I couldn't be more pleased. But you're half-legend already, and it's a grand romance you want; and you see it in me, but I'm telling you it's all fairy dust. What you want is a dashing knight errant.~ [adang108]

@1008 = ~Such a man is most in love with himself, I've found.~
@1009 = ~That sort of man wouldn't... know the things you do, Angelo.~
@1010 = ~Perhaps you are right.~
@1011 = ~Then you're the first lass I've met who could say so.~
@1012 = ~Perhaps, but you know well enough my appetite for lies. I don't flatter myself, but I flatter others.~
@1013 = ~I'll be blunt: he could learn.~
@1014 = ~Glad to hear it.~
@1015 = ~A kindly young shopkeeper, then.~
@1016 = ~I have no wish to knit sweaters and weed gardens.~
@1017 = ~There is more of such a man in you than you think.~
@1018 = ~But twenty years hence?~
@1019 = ~Shrewd, <CHARNAME>, shrewd. But whether true or not...~
@1020 = ~Gods, m'lady! I never thought I would say this, but there is more to life than that.~
@1021 = ~Some dark and mysterious elf, then.~
@1022 = ~I prefer honesty to mystery.~
@1023 = ~But he wouldn't make me laugh.~
@1024 = ~I'll let you know the moment I find one.~
@1025 = ~Is it me you call an honest man? Well, fair enough.~
@1026 = ~Hah! Then the wit is matched for this round.~
@1027 = ~True, such is rarer.~
@1028 = ~Oh gods, <CHARNAME>. You quite overpower my resolve. I'd get thee gone, for your own safety... and you know what I mean.~
@1029 = ~It doesn't have to be like this, Angelo.~
@1030 = ~It doesn't matter to me if you're a flawed man.~
@1031 = ~Angelo, your--resistance--it just doesn't make sense! Why?~
@1032 = ~Nay, it does. Please. <CHARNAME>, let me alone a while. I have to think. Perhaps... perhaps we will speak again.~
@1033 = ~<CHARNAME>, a moment?~ [adang109]
@1034 = ~What's the matter, Angelo? You look pale.~
@1035 = ~For you, Angelo? Any time.~
@1036 = ~Heh-heh-heh.~
@1037 = ~<CHARNAME>, let me pour out my heart.~
@1038 = ~Hells, I can't believe I said that. You know, I rehearsed it a dozen times last night. Laugh if you will. Pour out my heart... ? If I did, there'd be a heap of slime and chewed fish heads at your feet.~ [adang145]
@1039 = ~<CHARNAME>, you set me on fire. That last fight, when my arm nearly got taken off? You're to blame. Do I look sleepless these days? You again. If I weren't so old, I'd have been at your feet a week ago; and if I weren't so old, I wouldn't have the good sense to check myself, even now.~
@1040 = ~I've been meaning to ask. Exactly how old are you, Angelo?~
@1041 = ~So old? How old?~
@1042 = ~Awww, the moment, the moment!~
@1043 = ~Whoa, hold it right here! I am NOT interested.~
@1044 = ~Apologies, chief.~
@1045 = ~Nigh on fifty summers. For a sod who's been a smuggler, a mercenary, a soldier and a villain, that's a dotage.~
@1046 = ~Well, whenever you've sorted it out, I'll be here.~
@1047 = ~Well, whenever you've gotten over yourself, I'll be here.~
@1048 = ~I'm starting to get tired of waiting, Angelo.~
@1049 = ~Hear me out.~
@1050 = ~<CHARNAME>. Would you be my lover?~ [adang146]
@1051 = ~Gods, what a clumsy word; but I can't say husband, and "darling" and suchlike stick in my throat. Lover. Would you have me?~
@1052 = ~Yes, you've always known.~
@1053 = ~Actually, I was just teasing you. I had no idea it would get this far.~
@1054 = ~Angelo... I am sorry, but no.~
@1055 = ~(Nod.)~
@1056 = ~And do you know what you mean when you say that?~
@1057 = ~It means I would love, keep, and treasure you; and you me.~
@1058 = ~It means we would have a good time.~
@1059 = ~It means we could take care of each other.~
@1060 = ~In faith, I don't know what it means. Why do you ask me these questions?~
@1061 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. Forgive me these tests and riddles. My body's old, but as to the heart, I think it never grew past when I was twelve. It hadn't the occasion.~
@1062 = ~You know me for what I am. I'm the son of a whore. I never learned manners or dancing; all I know is the two-step and a Calimshan courtship number I could hardly show in society. I eat with my fingers and pick up the soup bowl.~
@1063 = ~Angelo, I hardly think I care about that kind of thing.~
@1064 = ~This is the open road, not high society!~
@1065 = ~I could teach you.~
@1066 = ~You know what, you're right.~
@1067 = ~True enough; but... ~
@1068 = ~Hah! Truly! <CHARNAME>, I will be honest, I would relish it; but...~
@1069 = ~I'm a criminal. I doubt I could be honest if I tried, I never learned the knack. For twenty years I lived by lying, and for all I brag, let's be honest: you could never take me at my word. You trusted me because you knew my interests were yours; you have a shrewder eye than you admit.~
@1070 = ~Perhaps, but you have proven yourself trustworthy. You can change.~
@1071 = ~No, Angelo. I trusted you then and I trust you now.~
@1072 = ~And who's to say I've never deceived you myself?~
@1073 = ~Can I? You were wiser then. But...~
@1074 = ~Then you were not wise, only lucky. Still... hearing that makes me happy, chief. But...~
@1075 = ~Heh. Perhaps you would be a match for me, after all. But...~
@1076 = ~I'm a damned carouser. To think I'd give up drink and women, your brother may as well have given up murder. A sod can't change after fifty years, chief, not when his fondest memories are in the cups and in the arms of girls he bought at ramshackle inns. Chief... for you... I'd try, but that sounds as weak as in fact it is.~
@1077 = ~I would try to understand. I know you couldn't change overnight.~
@1078 = ~I'd have no liking for that, but I am certain you could change.~
@1079 = ~I like a drink sometimes, and I'd not have you the jealous kind.~
@1080 = ~You are too good, m'lady, and yet somehow you still draw breath in this world. But...~
@1081 = ~With a stern hand, perhaps, though I think you would tire of it if I didn't. But...~
@1082 = ~You are a sensible girl. But that I could have been sensible when I thought I was free. But...~
@1083 = ~I'm a murderer. I killed a man first when I was twelve, in cold blood; and while he deserved it--as I lied to myself so many years they all deserved it--it was in cold blood. But what could I not do in cold blood; it's all that runs in these veins.~
@1084 = ~You've had a hard life. You did what you had to.~
@1085 = ~That's all in the past, Angelo.~
@1086 = ~These matters are for the gods to judge, not me.~
@1087 = ~So I'd fain tell myself, though it isn't the truth. Still, if you'd believe in me, I could almost believe in myself. But...~
@1088 = ~You say that of scores of innocent lives? Had I not fought alongside you, I would say you didn't know what you meant. Perhaps I understand. But...~
@1089 = ~Very well. They may damn me, if you but pardon me. But...~
@1090 = ~I served your brother. I would have sent you to gallows. And <CHARNAME>, if I ever said I didn't go willingly along with nearly all of it, I deceived you. My doubts were like flies, easily swatted until the very end. Even when my soul revolted in that vile temple, cowardice and habit nailed my feet to the floor. You have seen the worst of me and still... ?~ [adang147]
@1091 = ~Because I have seen the worst of you, I know you can become better.~
@1092 = ~I have forgiven you, Angelo; and if I had seen as much of my brother as I have of you, perhaps I could forgive him as well.~
@1093 = ~You said it yourself. Can't we just forget the past?~
@1094 = ~A funny answer. But apt.~
@1095 = ~What godly words are these? If not for the great esteem I bore you, I'd call you the greatest of fools. But I believe you... and I thank you.~
@1096 = ~I didn't mean it, <CHARNAME>. I was manuring you.~
@1097 = ~Forget the past, perhaps, but will the past forget us?~
@1098 = ~Do not mistake me for a penitent, <CHARNAME>. The day when I fall on my knees and beg forgiveness for all my numberless crimes is far off yet. But if you will accept me for what I am, knowing it full well, I will be satisfied.~
@1099 = ~Angelo... ~
@1100 = ~What about ME? I am a daughter of the mad dead god of murder!~
@1101 = ~Oh, do you think I give half a toss about that? I wouldn't care if you were the offspring of twelve mad gods and Cyric's sister. What kind of fool do you think I am?~ [adang148]
@1102 = ~Oh gods, how I love you. Let me have those lips; I've whetted my appetite long enough.~ [adang149]
@1103 = ~Yes...~
@1104 = ~So have I.~
@1105 = ~No!~
@1106 = ~Appetite? You... just go away.~
@1107 = ~(Seven minutes later.)~
@1108 = ~<CHARNAME>. If you want more of my clumsy and vile flattery... whores don't kiss. You don't know how much that meant to me.~
@1109 = ~It... meant a good deal to me, too... ~
@1110 = ~It was nothing special.~
@1111 = ~Truly?~
@1112 = ~It was... kind of spectacular, that's all.~
@1113 = ~Angelo, it was my first.~
@1114 = ~Hah. Then we shall have to better it in the future, shall we?~
@1115 = ~I'm pleased to hear that.~
@1116 = ~Truly? Then the honor is mine, <CHARNAME>. But before this talk, I would have counted myself the lowest dog to have had that honor.~
@1117 = ~Did the earth move?~
@1118 = ~What's with that lame line?~
@1119 = ~Yes. Wait, what?~
@1120 = ~Then the earth didn't move?~
@1121 = ~I don't know, it's some stupid line I heard in the army once. This one demolitions sod wouldn't shut up about it. Let's go to bed.~
@1122 = ~Wait, wait, this is going too fast!~
@1123 = ~Right now?~
@1124 = ~Yes, Angelo. Yes.~
@1125 = ~I thought you'd never ask.~
@1126 = ~Don't get me wrong. All I'd like to do is... don't laugh, <CHARNAME>. Can we just lie, and I'll hold you in my arms. I want to feel you and wake up in the morn beside you. Happen I'll die of shock when I do, I'll not believe it.~
@1127 = ~I think I'd like that.~
@1128 = ~Yes, I would like that best.~
@1129 = ~We don't have to stop there.~
@1130 = ~That's all? After all this?~
@1131 = ~Thank you. You don't know what a happy whoreson you've made me. I'll remember this when I'm hanging, or getting my head split open, and when I'm roasting in hell; and I won't have lived for nothing. How I love you.~
@1132 = ~It's been a long day, <CHARNAME>. No need to push a cart downhill. In time... believe me, I will do all I can to please you. How I love you.~
@1133 = ~You'll scold me, but I worry for you sometimes, seeing you at the front like that. What made you decide to take up a blade?~ [adang110]
@1134 = ~I'm strong. It seemed the natural thing.~
@1135 = ~I've always had a liking for weapons. They seem like extensions of my body.~
@1136 = ~I happened to have the right teachers, but I might have gone another way.~
@1137 = ~I always loved stories of knights and such. I never wanted to be the damsel, hiding behind them.~
@1138 = ~Of course, I expected no less. Well, do be careful. At least you're beside me, where I can get your back--and you can get mine.~
@1139 = ~A woodsman, eh? What does that make you? A woodsgirl? Heh, I like the sound of that. I like animals, and I'd like to see you with squirrels and rabbits scampering 'bout you.~ [adang111]
@1140 = ~This could be arranged.~
@1141 = ~Please, Angelo, there is far more to the path of nature than that.~
@1142 = ~You don't seem at home in nature yourself.~
@1143 = ~And bears and elks?~
@1144 = ~I'm a man of the city, born and bred, <CHARNAME>; but I admire you. My little woodsgirl.~
@1145 = ~How can I say this? You know it's said that young lasses fall for rogues, and happen one has; but this righteousness of yours, m'lady. Truth tell it makes me weak at the knees a'times. Mayhap because I'm a little afraid of it, being evil.~ [adang112]
@1146 = ~You are making fun of me, Angelo.~
@1147 = ~Ah-heh, heh.~
@1148 = ~There is more to being a paladin than titillating rogues, Angelo.~
@1149 = ~Oh, stop it, you aren't evil.~
@1150 = ~No jest. It isn't my way and yet there's something... alluring in it. Fight on, my noble one.~
@1151 = ~It can't be an accident you're a lady of the shadows, <CHARNAME>; for you've stolen my heart.~ [adang113]
@1152 = ~Beg pardon. I couldn't resist. Beg pardon, beg pardon!~
@1153 = ~Will you write a song for me someday, m'lady? A song of us? Just don't make it for the harp, I beg; something jauntier, perchance for the lute.~ [adang114]
@1154 = ~I'll see what I can do.~
@1155 = ~But I think the harp would suit you, Angelo.~
@1156 = ~I would rather the world not know of us, Angelo. Rather a private tune for two.~
@1157 = ~May I suggest the spoons and pot-lid?~
@1158 = ~Heh. But I love to hear your voice, m'lady. Sing for me tonight, would you? I feel the years turn back.~
@1159 = ~Ehm. Tell me, <CHARNAME>. Well... do you think your god approves of me?~ [adang115]
@1160 = ~Probably not. But we all stray, and they forgive.~
@1161 = ~Of course, Angelo, you're just their type.~
@1162 = ~Of course, Angelo, they forgive; more than we do.~
@1163 = ~I'll make a point of asking that when next I pray.~
@1164 = ~I don't mean to make light of this, <CHARNAME>. If this is a part of your life, I would make it a part of mine, learn to understand. Err. Don't get the conversion papers out yet, or however it works.~
@1165 = ~Beautiful, and I know I'll never be half the spellcaster you are. You're really something, m'lady.~ [adang116]
@1166 = ~Don't be ridiculous, Angelo! You are powerful.~
@1167 = ~Hee-hee. Right?~
@1168 = ~I could help... teach you, if you like.~
@1169 = ~Well, I can hardly lift a sword, though.~
@1170 = ~Mayhap. Well, I would relish the chance to learn at your feet. Still, I hope with what skill I have, I've been of some service to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1171 = ~Beg pardon, m'lady, if I ever made light of you. You've really taught me something, turned what I knew on its head. That a girl could fight so well and fight without weapons...~ [adang117]
@1172 = ~It isn't my strength, Angelo, but the history of the monk's art behind me.~
@1173 = ~Hah! I showed you.~
@1174 = ~Yes, Angelo, there are many kinds of strength.~
@1175 = ~Jealous?~
@1176 = ~Don't get me wrong, I still trust my blade and my spellbook. But sometimes, m'lady, I'm a little in awe of you.~
@1177 = ~Say, m'lady. We've traveled together a while, and shared more than a kind word, but I still feel I know little of you. And... I'd know more.~ [adang118]
@1178 = ~Yes, such as?~
@1179 = ~I'm sorry, Angelo, but not right at the moment.~
@1180 = ~Such as little things. Little things, that's all.~
@1181 = ~Tell me your favorite color.~
@1182 = ~Red!~
@1183 = ~Blue!~
@1184 = ~Green!~
@1185 = ~Yellow!~
@1186 = ~Black!~
@1187 = ~Purple!~
@1188 = ~Brown!~

@1190 = ~Pink!~
@1191 = ~Puce!~
@1192 = ~White!~
@1193 = ~You know, I already told a Harper this... ~
@1194 = ~The color of passion and romance, eh?~
@1195 = ~The color of peace, and the sea?~
@1196 = ~The color of life and nature?~
@1197 = ~The color of gold, I wonder, or that fellow up in the sky?~
@1198 = ~The color of elegance and secrecy, eh?~
@1199 = ~The color of royalty and luxury, eh?~
@1200 = ~Good honest dirt? But that's mine, too!~
@1201 = ~Truly? Well, we need not have all in common.~
@1202 = ~As Imoen's hair? A pretty color, it suits you.~
@1203 = ~Unique, eh? Like yourself.~
@1204 = ~Yes, prying bugger, wasn't he. What did you say again?~
@1205 = ~Of course, I could have guessed. Thank you, m'lady, I'll be sure to wear a spot of it. What do you like more than anything in the world?~
@1206 = ~You, of course.~
@1207 = ~The feeling after I've triumphed over a powerful foe.~
@1208 = ~Seeing a smile on the face of one I've helped.~
@1209 = ~A warm meal on a cold night.~
@1210 = ~A nice, long bath.~
@1211 = ~Finding something interesting, new.~
@1212 = ~The company and laughter of my friends.~
@1213 = ~Reading.~
@1214 = ~Becoming stronger.~
@1215 = ~Grinding my foe's neck under my heel.~
@1216 = ~The great outdoors.~
@1217 = ~Remembering the past, bittersweet.~
@1218 = ~Oh ha, ha! Come now.~
@1219 = ~You must be happy often, then.~
@1220 = ~And you've helped many.~
@1221 = ~Truly? But that's my answer. You're a girl after my heart, <CHARNAME>.~
@1222 = ~Heh. Then you must find happiness hard to come by, chief.~
@1223 = ~A nice answer. I think I know what you mean, though it's not my answer.~
@1224 = ~You must be happy often, then. You've made many friends.~
@1225 = ~You're a girl after my own heart, <CHARNAME>.~
@1226 = ~Woah-hoh! Well, go to it, go to it.~
@1227 = ~I see. Well, we needn't agree.~
@1228 = ~Truly? I find more of the bitter than the sweet, but sometimes yes--I know what you mean.~
@1229 = ~Of course, I'd expect nothing less. What do you hate more than anything?~
@1230 = ~Men who ask me too many questions.~
@1231 = ~Powerful foes who hound me for no good reason.~
@1232 = ~Being tired.~
@1233 = ~Being poor.~
@1234 = ~The undead.~
@1235 = ~Anyone who stands in my way.~
@1236 = ~The thought of having to die.~
@1237 = ~Noise.~
@1238 = ~Noober.~
@1239 = ~Being bored.~
@1240 = ~Any threat to my friends.~
@1241 = ~Rich people.~
@1242 = ~Beggars.~
@1243 = ~Ha. Fair enough.~
@1244 = ~Then you've had enough of that, eh?~
@1245 = ~But thank the gods for sleep, eh? I can't get enough of it.~
@1246 = ~Well, there's worse, isn't there?~
@1247 = ~You too, m'lady? Gods, we're alike as two gourds on a vine.~
@1248 = ~Woah-hoh! Well, good on ya.~
@1249 = ~I know. Well, just don't think about it.~
@1250 = ~You like peace and quiet, eh? That's the girl I know.~
@1251 = ~That fellow? I've met him, too. Come on, he wasn't so bad.~
@1252 = ~They can get tiresome, can't they?~
@1253 = ~Oh come now, chief, they can't help it. Still... I know what you mean.~
@1254 = ~Of course, of course. I suppose it's all no surprise... but I like to hear it from your mouth, as I like anything that comes hence. Let's talk more... you and I. Believe me, I'm not used to this.~
@1255 = ~You'll laugh, m'lady, but I like to imagine you as a girl. It makes me smile. You grew up in that library, didn't you? You and Imoen both.~ [adang119]
@1256 = ~Yes, Angelo, Candlekeep. A place full of kindness and learning, as I knew it.~
@1257 = ~Yes, Angelo, Candlekeep. A dull place full of chores and stern looks.~
@1258 = ~I don't like to remember the past any more than you, Angelo.~
@1259 = ~We did, but I don't have time to discuss it now.~
@1260 = ~A princess in her ivory tower, eh?~
@1261 = ~Oh, I was a grub-faced little rascal, make no mistake.~
@1262 = ~I couldn't have said it better myself. I ruled my tiny realm--as much as I could.~
@1263 = ~So I imagined myself, though they saw me as "errand girl;" but I was glad to help.~
@1264 = ~Who's talking about Imoen?~
@1265 = ~Well, it didn't prove much a tower in the end.~
@1266 = ~Hah! I can imagine it even better.~
@1267 = ~I knew it! Ah, those damned peasants didn't know how good they had it.~
@1268 = ~I'm sure you were the glue that held the place together, <CHARNAME>.~
@1269 = ~Heh, heh. So that's how it was?~
@1270 = ~No. I suppose you're right.~
@1271 = ~Did you learn your lessons?~
@1272 = ~With so much natural talent, I hardly needed to.~
@1273 = ~Yes, and I was grateful for the instruction.~
@1274 = ~Indifferently. I... wasn't a very quick study.~
@1275 = ~When they could catch me, yes.~
@1276 = ~Hee! Modest as always, chief.~
@1277 = ~That's m'lady. I can see you buckling down to it, no wonder you've come so far.~
@1278 = ~It takes a big girl to admit it. I'm with you there, chief; I could never stand lessons.~
@1279 = ~Ha! But of course.~
@1280 = ~And you minded your chores?~
@1281 = ~It didn't prepare me well for this life, did it?~
@1282 = ~Yes, and I dearly miss them.~
@1283 = ~"Minded?" Did I mind anything else?~
@1284 = ~Not in the slightest.~
@1285 = ~(sigh) No, I suppose it didn't.~
@1286 = ~Do you now? I see what you mean.~
@1287 = ~Heh. Well you're free of them now.~
@1288 = ~Of course.~
@1289 = ~You didn't have many friends there, did you?~
@1290 = ~You're joking! All the stableboys knew me by nickname.~
@1291 = ~No, I suppose not, but Imoen and Gorion's love were enough.~
@1292 = ~I always preferred the company of grown-ups, anyway.~
@1293 = ~I always liked to be on my own.~
@1294 = ~Hmm. I'm not sure how I feel about this.~
@1295 = ~Yes. I can imagine.~
@1296 = ~That's the <CHARNAME> I know; but it's a shame we all get one shot at being young, and one only.~
@1297 = ~Of course, of course. What was I thinking?~
@1298 = ~Ah... ~
@1299 = ~That girl. I see her in my mind's eye. And I'd just tuck her in and tell her everything would be right. But it wouldn't, would it. Who could have made her imagine, had they told her? What would take place. And that I'd have a part in it... ~
@1300 = ~Beg pardon for bringing this up, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps it was a mistake... we'll speak later, eh?~
@1301 = ~M'lady, what was it like to have a father?~ [adang000]
@1302 = ~Ah, well...~
@1303 = ~Where did that come from!~
@1304 = ~I'm sorry, Angelo, we have no time for this at the moment.~
@1305 = ~Beg pardon for springing it on you like that. Happen it's not a question that could be answered in a word or two. But truly, I'm curious.~
@1306 = ~You know I never had a father, Angelo.~
@1307 = ~Do you mean Gorion?~
@1308 = ~Yes, Gorion was like a father to me.~
@1309 = ~Right, the old mage. I, ah... never met him myself. But you know that story.~
@1310 = ~I never truly thought of him as a father. He was rather cold and distant.~
@1311 = ~I never truly thought of him as a father. He did his best, but there was a distance between us.~
@1312 = ~Oh, he tried to be a father, but I'd much rather have raised myself.~

@1317 = ~And--beg pardon--what of your other sire?~
@1318 = ~I would rather not even think of it.~
@1319 = ~Bhaal? Sarevok was right, there is no bond between Bhaal and myself.~
@1320 = ~I suppose he was another sire. Between Gorion's wisdom and his power, I have my inheritance.~
@1321 = ~Yes, he was my true father. I would follow in his footsteps.~
@1322 = ~Yes, he was my true father. He may have been a god of murder, but I will use his power in my own way.~
@1323 = ~Fair enough, m'lady. Neither would I, were I you.~
@1324 = ~Fair enough, m'lady. I'm... glad to hear it, happen it proves true.~
@1325 = ~Interesting. But no matter what sort of man Gorion was, I'd lay my money you should take after him.~
@1326 = ~Yeesh! It chills my bones to hear that, chief. I hope you'll conduct yourself with a little temperance, but you know that.~
@1327 = ~Thank you for sharing this. I will think on it.~
@1328 = ~You never knew your father, did you?~
@1329 = ~Why did you want to know?~
@1330 = ~Well, let's not talk about this any more.~
@1331 = ~Well, you know, I wouldn't have minded meeting my father. Happen I was curious what sort of man he would prove. I'll never know now. But on the whole, I'm not unhappy with my lot.~

@1333 = ~But don't you wish you had had guidance, instruction?~

@1336 = ~Happen it would have done me some good. It's too late now; and no, I never felt the absence.~
@1337 = ~Not for a very long time, <CHARNAME>.~
@1338 = ~In Kara-Tur, with the power fathers have, you'd sometimes think they had fashioned their children--daughters especially--out of clay. I never knew that, and it seemed silly to me. Happen I thought children fell out of the air, or it was their mothers crafted them, no help needed.~
@1339 = ~I've never thought much on this before, <CHARNAME>... It's only now I realize what I've been thinking my whole life.~
@1340 = ~And perhaps even... gods, my thoughts are spinning beyond my grip. But with fathers there are rules. But with mothers there's only life, life going on and on. And happen that's the way I've looked at things. But in the world there are fathers and mothers both.~
@1341 = ~Perchance after all, there's something I've missed...~
@1342 = ~You never knew your mother.~
@1343 = ~Well, the day's getting on. Let's talk some other time.~
@1344 = ~No, though I have a vague memory of her. It's been a comfort to me.~

@1346 = ~No, and I never wished for one.~
@1347 = ~I had Jaheira.~
@1348 = ~I can't imagine it. But it would be an easy trick to imagine yourself the daughter of a god, perhaps, not knowing the womb you came from...~
@1349 = ~Ah, yes.~
@1350 = ~Forgive me. Thank you in any case for this, m'lady, it's given me much to think on.~
@1351 = ~And so we face another day. You've come a long way from Candlekeep, m'lady, though I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that.~ [adang167]
@1352 = ~Yes. Although I often wish I could return.~
@1353 = ~Yes, and thank the gods! I'm glad to be shut of the place.~
@1354 = ~Yes, and although it has been hard, I have seen and learned much.~
@1355 = ~No need at the moment to tell me anything, Angelo, I'm busy.~
@1356 = ~I thought I caught a note of yearning when you spoke of it. In truth, perhaps it's affected me. I almost wish I could return there, though I never was there... It sounds like a pleasant place in its way.~
@1357 = ~Yes, I thought as much. You didn't seem enamored of it before.~
@1358 = ~And that's true too. A glance back and nothing more, eh?~
@1359 = ~Fair enough, I should have known.~
@1360 = ~Happen this will sound like blasphemy coming from my mouth, chief...but I think Gorion, if he could see you. Well, he'd be proud of you.~
@1361 = ~Oh, stop it! You're making me tear up!~
@1362 = ~I can only hope so, Angelo.~
@1363 = ~Are you joking? I have gone against everything he believed in!~
@1364 = ~I hardly care what the dead old codger thinks.~
@1365 = ~But he can see me, Angelo--from the heavens.~
@1366 = ~Beg pardon, then, I'd not make you dwell on it.~
@1367 = ~Take my word for it. Heh, well.~
@1368 = ~Well... be that as it may, you're strong. You've done well for yourself. And there are still many worse.~
@1369 = ~Woah-ho! I didn't know you felt so strongly. Alright, forget I said anything.~
@1370 = ~Chief... I hate to prick your bubble, but I have serious doubts the denizens of the heavens spend their days spying on us. Why, the old man might be making the acquaintance of an aspect of Sune even as we speak--joking, joking!~
@1371 = ~In any case, you've traveled far. I suppose I can relate to that. It's something, isn't it? In Kozakura there's a saying: "Let your darling children travel." Silly as it may sound... I think he would have wanted that for you.~
@1372 = ~If I had my choice, I never would have left. What do I want more than books and safety?~
@1373 = ~Yes, indeed! I want to see as much as possible!~
@1374 = ~Perhaps, but I've had quite enough excitement for one lifetime.~
@1375 = ~Hee-hee. But why read of a place when you could see it with your own eyes? Heh. My little bookworm.~
@1376 = ~That's the spirit, chief!~
@1377 = ~True enough, between the Gate and Amn, you've seen more than many a sod. Still...~
@1378 = ~I've seen many a place myself, and... someday, <CHARNAME>, I would like to show them to you. I don't like to think much on the future, it's marshy ground, but if I have one thought.~
@1379 = ~I would be delighted.~
@1380 = ~Why stop there? Let's sail across the sea, to the unknown lands!~
@1381 = ~It's a nice thought, Angelo, but with matters as they are...~
@1382 = ~Nor do I like to think on it, Angelo. We shall see what it holds.~
@1383 = ~We are settling down in a tiny village and never ever leaving it.~
@1384 = ~Calimshan, Sembia, Kara-Tur...~
@1385 = ~Take me to Kara-Tur.~
@1386 = ~Take me to Sembia.~
@1387 = ~Take me to Calimshan.~
@1388 = ~Unknown lands! Unknown lands!~
@1389 = ~Woah-ho! Kara-Tur is plenty far off, chief. Let's see how it goes, eh?~
@1390 = ~Aye, you've a point there. Perhaps I should not have spoken, when it comes to that.~
@1391 = ~Fair enough. You are a girl after my own heart, then.~
@1392 = ~Well...I could have far worse, I suppose. If that's your wish, m'lady.~
@1393 = ~Then it's a promise. Someday, m'lady.~
@1394 = ~M'lady <CHARNAME>? I once told you I knew right from wrong, but perhaps it would be fairer to say I thought I did. The question has been on my mind more and more of late. Might I sound you out on a point?~ [adang120]
@1395 = ~But of course, Angelo.~
@1396 = ~But I didn't think you cared about that, Angelo.~
@1397 = ~Another time, perhaps.~
@1398 = ~Beg pardon, beg pardon!~
@1399 = ~Mm. I never said I didn't care. I think about it, I always have, but it never seemed worth the action.~
@1400 = ~Do you think it's right to steal from the rich?~
@1401 = ~Of course. They have more than enough already.~
@1402 = ~Despite the temptation, no.~
@1403 = ~Stealing is never proper. Two wrongs don't make a right.~
@1404 = ~What, just from the rich?~
@1405 = ~That's my thinking, too; or it would be if I were poor.~
@1406 = ~Never? Hard words, chief. That's what trips me up.~
@1407 = ~Ha, ha. Of course.~
@1408 = ~Execute prisoners?~
@1409 = ~It depends on the rules of the battle, culture and such.~
@1410 = ~No, Angelo. Killing is never right.~
@1411 = ~It would dishonor them to allow them to live.~
@1412 = ~Prisoners?~
@1413 = ~Yes, that's my thinking too.~
@1414 = ~Never. Never?~
@1415 = ~You'd be right at home in Kara-Tur, m'lady.~
@1416 = ~Woah-hoh! Nothing less from the chief.~
@1417 = ~Here's an old chestnut, but a good one. What if you could save a hundred lives by taking a dozen?~
@1418 = ~It's cruel, but what else could one do?~
@1419 = ~It would be hard, but I still could not allow it, myself.~
@1420 = ~Save?~
@1421 = ~This makes no sense. It has no context.~
@1422 = ~Aye, perhaps so.~
@1423 = ~Hmm. I'm sure the hundred would appreciate your moral rigor. But no, I appreciate that.~
@1424 = ~Nice, quick, and practical. Hard, though.~
@1425 = ~Ha, ha, Why did I even ask?~
@1426 = ~It's hypothetical, chief. Imagine some mad wizard is striking a deal. Gods know stranger has happened to you.~
@1427 = ~Thank you. It was a passing curiosity, that's all.~
@1428 = ~You're a good woman, <CHARNAME>. I don't know how you do it.~
@1429 = ~It's not as hard as you think, Angelo. You're a good man in a way.~
@1430 = ~I'm not good, Angelo. I've been lucky, that's all.~
@1431 = ~Well, it hasn't been easy.~
@1432 = ~Sadly, the good must often be joined to the powerful.~
@1433 = ~"In a way," is it? Truer words never spoken.~
@1434 = ~And add modesty to your list of virtues? That's my girl.~
@1435 = ~No, it hasn't. Has it.~
@1436 = ~Is that so? It makes sense, though I can't say I like it. If there were "good," I would hope it stood up for itself.~
@1437 = ~Well, I see you're as brutal a cuss as I am, m'lady. I guess I can set my mind at ease.~
@1438 = ~You know, m'lady, my mind goes back to that day. I suspect yours does, as well.~ [adang121]
@1439 = ~What day do you mean? There have been many "days" in our lives.~
@1440 = ~Of course. I think on it often.~
@1441 = ~Of course I mean... well, you know.~
@1442 = ~Yes, Angelo.~
@1443 = ~What on earth are you talking about?~
@1444 = ~My... little mock-trial. I'm sure we don't need to go over the details, we know them well enough.~
@1445 = ~I would be interested to know how you saw it, Angelo.~
@1446 = ~You flatter yourself, Angelo. My life was in danger more than once in those days and has been since.~
@1447 = ~I don't like to think of, Angelo. What's past is past.~
@1448 = ~You told Imoen you had taken lotus.~
@1449 = ~Then...~
@1450 = ~That's the thing, chief. I hardly saw it. It was one moment of many, nearly all of them bad. With each task I thought it might be the last, that enough blood would have been shed, that... he'd be content. I didn't object to the blood, I didn't like it either.~
@1451 = ~Heh. Perhaps it weighs more heavily on my mind, then.~
@1452 = ~Aye... perhaps you're right. To the future, then. The future... <CHARNAME>.~
@1453 = ~Yes, and as I told her, I still knew what I was doing. It just made it... easier. I took it a lot in those days, more than ever since I was young.~
@1454 = ~<CHARNAME>, m'lady. By now an apology would sound weak. I only think of it. I barely remember what you looked like. And to think that now, I can talk to you, hold you, kiss you. And that I'd cut the arms off any man who'd do the same to you.~
@1455 = ~Life is strange, Angelo.~
@1456 = ~It was fate, perhaps, and who knows its workings?~
@1457 = ~It was the will of the gods that it should be like this.~
@1458 = ~I'm glad to hear it.~
@1459 = ~Strange. Yes. I couldn't have said it better.~
@1460 = ~Semaj, my teacher used to say, fate's a word for when you have no other. And so it is here, I suppose.~
@1461 = ~Perhaps so. Then I'll swallow my pride and thank them.~
@1462 = ~And I'm glad to say it.~
@1463 = ~Did you... this is stupid. But you knew I'd ask it. Did you see me?~
@1464 = ~I saw another lackey of my brother. I bore you no malice, at least.~
@1465 = ~I hated you then. It is hard to imagine how things have changed.~
@1466 = ~Somehow, I imagined you were a good officer, turned by Sarevok's bribes.~
@1467 = ~Are you joking? Of course I thought, who is that handsome man behind the desk? I wonder what he'd look like without those leathers, if only he weren't my executioner...~
@1468 = ~As expected. Yes, that was the way; you and I were alike.~
@1469 = ~I'm sorry to hear that, <CHARNAME>, but hardly surprised.~
@1470 = ~A pretty fancy, then. You always did see the best in others.~
@1471 = ~Ha, ha! If only. But if there is a word of truth in that, I thank you for it.~
@1472 = ~I killed Scar, <CHARNAME>.~ [adang122]
@1473 = ~I had guessed as much.~
@1474 = ~Well, I never liked him myself.~
@1475 = ~It makes me sad to hear that, but it comes as no surprise.~
@1476 = ~He was a good man... I don't know. M'lady, whether it's fate or the gods or happenstance, it is cussed strange. And wondrous. But how... I'd protect you now. Can you feel safe in these arms, remembering that?~
@1477 = ~It troubles me sometimes, but I try not to think of it.~
@1478 = ~It never bothered me in the slightest.~
@1479 = ~I feel safe enough, it would blot out worse memories.~
@1480 = ~Perhaps... I don't want to feel entirely safe.~
@1481 = ~I am sorry to hear that. If there were some way to erase what's been done. But there isn't.~
@1482 = ~If that's true... then thank you. It takes a load off my heart, you can't imagine.~
@1483 = ~Truly? A novel thought. Well, if such be your pleasure, then whatever keeps you in my arms I welcome.~
@1484 = ~Thank you, m'lady. Words, much less my sort of words, could never express how glad I am that you live, and that you're mine.~
@1485 = ~"See how the fates their gifts alot." Gods, chief, I don't believe it.~ [adang123]
@1486 = ~First, that a filthy, gods-damned rascal like me could have such a prize as you; but you knew that already. I meant that one sire could have such different issues.~
@1487 = ~On the one hand, your brother; humorless, cold, creased brow, a murderer. You; bright, brilliant, loving, sweet. It defies all reason.~
@1488 = ~From what you've said, my brother was not always like this.~
@1489 = ~But Sarevok had those who loved him, too.~
@1490 = ~I'm flattered, I think.~
@1491 = ~No, I suppose not; but more and more it's how I remember him.~
@1492 = ~Yes, whom he pushed away one by one.~
@1493 = ~As well you ought to be.~
@1494 = ~Whether it was something inside of him that ate away little by little; or whether it came from outside and mastered him; it was in his nature either to turn or to submit. And you and he are as like as night and day.~
@1495 = ~Don't be so sure. There are two sides to everyone.~
@1496 = ~He didn't have the help I've had. Friends, teachers... lovers.~
@1497 = ~Thank you, Angelo. I do worry sometimes.~
@1498 = ~Yes, but the question is which we turn to the world.~
@1499 = ~Perhaps there was a difference in quality, chief, if not in kind.~
@1500 = ~Worry not. If I know anything, and I know precious little, you will never be like him. You have been tried worse than he and only emerged bright and new, and you will always be the girl I love.~
@1501 = ~(You notice Angelo gazing quietly at you. You have grown used to this of late, and only smile back; but you realize he is watching you for a reason.)~ [adang000]
@1502 = ~(Looking down, you see an orange butterfly has settled on your breast, so light a touch you could hardly have noticed. It flaps its wings gently and seems intent on its tiny business, ignoring you.)~
@1503 = ~(When you look up again, Angelo is smiling sadly. You understand that the scene had touched him, that he reads something in it. You are unsure what that may be, but you also know that you cannot know. To ask him whether the butterfly is you, he, or your love, and what for that matter your armored breast represents, would only elicit a shake of his head you can imagine perfectly.)~

@1505 = ~Why are all elves so gods-damned beautiful? You never see an ugly elf. Happen their gods were more on the job than ours. But you put them all in the shade, light ones and dark ones alike, <CHARNAME>.~ [adang124]

@1507 = ~I'm incensed, Angelo! I had rather my race didn't matter to you.~
@1508 = ~A good pair we make, like a pipe-organ going down the street. Kidding, <CHARNAME>. I love my little one. Leastways if we ever wed, I'll have an easy job bearing you over the threshold, eh?~ [adang125]
@1509 = ~Am I a halfling, then? I hadn't noticed.~
@1510 = ~Truth tell, I'm rather glad you're the daughter of some dead god, <CHARNAME>. Happen otherwise, you'd take me home to some stone-faced clan who'd glare at me over the dinner table. I haven't known many hospitable dwarfs--present lovely company, of course, excluded, my sweet.~ [adang126]
@1511 = ~Am I a dwarf, then? I hadn't noticed.~
@1512 = ~I tell you, most men haven't got a notion of what they're missing. Happen we should ever part--the gods forbid!--I just might seek out another lass with orcish blood. I can't tell you how fine it feels to get hugged back as hard as I hug, <CHARNAME>; and every day I think those nubs are more becoming.~ [adang127]

@1520 = ~I... will make a clean breast. Recently, we have exchanged words. Fond words, I thought. It seemed to me, rather as if perhaps... there were a friendship of a special quality growing 'twixt us. A fond friendship, so to speak. Was I mistaken?~
@1521 = ~I am afraid you were, Anomen. I value you as one of my friends, nothing more.~

Why do you persist in making eyes at this Angelo Dosan, this uncouth opportunist, this smirking... debauched... philanderer! I value the man as a comrade-in-arms, but I would not trust him with my sister, let alone... you, <CHARNAME>.~

@1592 = ~That's funny, I can see it now, but you don't look that Kara-Turan.~
@1593 = ~So, your mother was from Kara-Tur?~
@1594 = ~Wait and hear. Dosan's my mother's name but you'll never meet an Angelo in Kara-Tur. My mother said my father was a Sembian merchant, and she'd given me his name. When I came of age, I struck out looking for the bastard. Don't know why. When I got to Sembia he was dead, but his business partner, whom I might add I highly suspected of the deed, took me on as a bodyguard. After that it was the army. Mercenary army in Sembia, pays well for able men. Twenty-odd years.~
@1595 = ~That's where you met Anchev, right?~
@1596 = ~So how does my brother come into this?~
@1597 = ~Go on.~
@1598 = ~Rieltar picked me up. A move back into the private sector, once I'd earned my chops in the army, meant better money. Brunos Rockweigh, Rieltar's valet, came to him the same way. I strong-armed for the Throne for a year or so before I met... him. But, we were talking about me here, not that... individual.~
@1599 = ~Rieltar took me with him to the Gate. You may not know this, but the Throne was in the Gate for a time before that... business. They had to build up before they could put their plan in action, which, I might add, I didn't know of until fairly late. Rieltar got me attached to the Fist as an 'independent contractor,' which is what they call the bounty hunters they use for their dirty work; it's like being a sergeant in the army; and with some strings pulled, I climbed the ranks, all the time on the Throne's payroll.~
@1600 = ~About then I got to know your brother. Liked him better than his father. He wasn't so crazy then... but that's a story for another day. I liked that Tamoko but Sarevok got to her first. That mageling of his, Semaj, started teaching me magic. You'll snort to hear this, chief... but... those were good days. Good as a man like me could hope for. That was before it all started going wrong.~
@1601 = ~And how did it go wrong?~
@1602 = ~When Gorion was murdered, right?~
@1603 = ~That's when I come in.~
@1604 = ~Now, now, like I said, a story for another day. I can't believe you got me talking so damn much. You really aren't a thing like your brother. Well when it comes to that, I couldn't be more pleased.~
@1605 = ~<CHARNAME>... I know the difference between right and wrong. But it's an unjust world. The question isn't what's right, but how much right can you do before you put your foot in your grave. My answer always was, not damn much.~
@1606 = ~So, what did it feel like when you sentenced me to die?~
@1607 = ~You could have let me go in Baldur's Gate, for one thing.~
@1608 = ~Do I sense a barb there? Hah. What did it feel like when you had me at your mercy?~
@1609 = ~Honestly? I figured you'd mostly likely done something to deserve it. If we've been alive, odds are we've all done something to deserve it. And that's the most you can say.~
@1610 = ~You like 'em? Black Lizard initiation ink. The more you have, the bigger you were. Of course it's rare to see them on a sod walking around, since most are dead 'afore they get out. I've got the arms, the back and the buttocks, which means I was no thug; but if I'd made chief, they'd go all the way up my neck. But here, this little beauty... got her in the army. Watch it; I flex and she winks. What can I say, it seemed like a fine idea when I was twenty.~
@1611 = ~In the romantic sense? One, mayhap two. In the worldly sense? Ah, chief... if it's a hot day and I'm swatting flies, I don't know how many I swat, just there were a damn lot of 'em.~
@1612 = ~That's disgusting!~
@1613 = ~Tell me more... ~
@1614 = ~Eh-heh! You'll be a terror yet. Mothers of Amn, lock up your daughters! You want to see something? This here, this was written by some old Kara-Turan monk back 'afore the Time of Troubles: the Kaera Paka Sada. Sixty-one ways to love your lover.~
@1615 = ~They had it all sussed back then; you spent the first half of your life sowing your oats, then when the hair turned gray, you settled down and started praying. So what the title means is something like 'A Guide For Living For the Young.' Of course now days, we forget all that religion, and young and old alike keep it on their bedside table. And in my day I did, believe me. They ate it up in Sembia, did they ever... ~
@1616 = ~You know what? You take it. Gods know I don't get much use out of it these days. Let the old make way for the young. I tell you, number twenty and number fifty-seven come highly recommended, heh. I could never get your brother interested. Maybe that Kara-Turan girl taught him everything he needed to know.~
@1617 = ~Of course I have. What kind of daft question is that? We all have our first love, even bastards like me.~
@1618 = ~Tell me about her.~
@1619 = ~Will you tell me?~
@1620 = ~What's to tell? It's the same story the world 'round. Before I fell in with the Lizard, mother, gods bless her, tried to send me to school. There was a girl... Sayuri. Gods bless that little heart. I sat behind her, her hair smelled nice, so I slipped a note in her shoe cubby. We ate together, we took walks... one day I confessed. That sweet little smile of hers, I can see it now...~
@1621 = ~So what happened to her?~
@1622 = ~What did she say?~
@1623 = ~You wound my old heart with that question. The tentacle demons got her.~
@1624 = ~Tentacle demons?~
@1625 = ~Somehow, I don't get the feeling you're telling the truth.~
@1626 = ~Tentacle demons, chief. A real plague on Kara-Tur, especially in the schools. You don't want to know what they do with those tentacles.~
@1627 = ~Why do I get the feeling this story is something less than fact?~
@1628 = ~Ewww. Don't go near me.~
@1629 = ~Because you're getting wiser? I'll tell you the real story some other day.~
@1630 = ~Fine, then. You understand I don't like to talk about this.~
@1631 = ~What really happened was, Sayuri and me were in the army. She was a quick little scout, quick as she was pretty. But after we finished basic training, they had this exercise to weed out the feeble. One day when we showed up for muster, some mage cast a spell and we passed out, woke up on this island.~
@1632 = ~Given weapons and spell scrolls at random, forced to kill each other, friend against friend. There could only be one winner and they'd be taken in the force. Sayuri and me, back-to-back, we fought it out against our former comrades; and I'd been fond of some of them. God I hate to remember those days. It even turned my stomach, chief, if you can believe that. Finally it was just me and Sayuri.~
@1633 = ~But like I said... there could only be one winner. And before I knew it, I had an arrow sticking between my shoulderblades. But when I turned around, and she saw my face... she turned the bow on herself... ~
@1634 = ~How can you turn a bow on yourself?~
@1635 = ~And?~
@1636 = ~You're lying again!~
@1637 = ~It's not a pretty sight, believe me.~
@1638 = ~Brilliant deduction as always, chief. I'm tired... it's been a long day.~
@1639 = ~Very well, very well. But I warn you, truth is stranger than fiction! I'll tell you the story, but you might not believe it.~
@1640 = ~The truth is, when I was a boy, my mother took ill with some foreign malady and I had to go to some village shaman to get the remedy. One of my friends went with me. Now the village was off in the mountains, and it was winter; and coming back we got caught in a hell of a blizzard. You couldn't see a foot in front of your face. We took shelter in an abandoned riverman's hut and prayed to the eight million gods, wrapped up in our coats and hunkered down for the night.~
@1641 = ~Now in the night, happen I woke and saw a beautiful woman standing over us. Words couldn't describe her, chief. Her beauty was frightening and her skin was white as snow. She said to me, "I was going to treat you like your friend, but you're such a handsome, strapping lad I'll spare your life. But if you ever tell anyone what your eyes have seen tonight, mark my words, you'll regret it!" Then I blinked my eyes and she was gone. I shook my friend to tell him about it, but the poor lad was gone too--frozen solid during the night.~
@1642 = ~Well, the next day I went on, and on the way I met a girl named Sayuri. She said she was traveling to Wa, but we got to talking and--well chief, in Kara-Tur there's a saying: "The eyes say what the mouth cannot." She ending up staying with me while I nursed my poor mother back to health, and we got along quite well. Oh yes indeed.~
@1643 = ~But the next winter I was walking with Sayuri, and it was snowing. Happen I turned to her and said, "you know, in this light, you remind me of a woman I saw last year...now perchance you won't believe this, but..." And forgetting all about the Snow-Woman's warning, I told her every last word.~
@1644 = ~Now being smarter than me, I'm sure you've guessed the whole of it. Right off Sayuri's eyes flashed and she said in a voice like a storm: "Fool, that woman was I! I should kill you on the spot for breaking your word, but you're such a fine piece of manhood that I can't bring myself to...but you will never see me again!"--and just like that, she vanished in a whirl of snowflakes. Poof!~
@1645 = ~How tragic!~
@1646 = ~You know, I might believe you if I hadn't read that story in "Exotic Folk Tales of Far-Off Kara-Tur," back in Candlekeep.~
@1647 = ~Ha, ha! Gotcha.~
@1648 = ~My only wish is to entertain you, chief.~
@1649 = ~Alright, alright. This time I swear on my mother's honor.~
@1650 = ~The truth is, when I was grown but before I fell in with the Lizard, I worked a spell as a tapster at a public house. It was hard work, and the boss was a tyrant, but I needed the gold. One day when I was emptying the slops, I saw Sayuri on the back steps, sitting beside a fine wooden case. She was about my age and she looked a proper young lady. So I, having no more sense in my head than now, plopped myself down and started talking to her. I told her all my hopes and dreams and that even though I was just a tapster, I hoped to be rich and famous some day.~
@1651 = ~Sayuri was quiet and she didn't seem to mind. The wood case she had looked like the sort that bards keep their lutes in, so I asked if she played an instrument. She only nodded. I asked her to play for me, but she said she was too shy. Alright, I said, maybe next time. So she promised she'd come back.~
@1652 = ~But it turned out Sayuri was no ordinary girl. She'd been raised from birth by another criminal clan, the Fighting Carp, to be an assassin; and it was no lute in that case, but a miniature crossbow. Happen she was there that day because her target was staying at my public house, and she was scoping it out.~
@1653 = ~I think she loved me, as I had fallen for her, but her employer had told her to eliminate anyone who got in her way. The next day she snuck in the back, climbed to the top floor and killed her target--and coming out of his room, she ran into me. I didn't have a moment to understand what was happening before she put a crossbow bolt in my heart...~
@1654 = ~And yet you're still alive. Strange.~
@1655 = ~I'm starting to wonder if I can trust you at all, Angelo!~
@1656 = ~Now, chief. If I told you the truth now, you'd be disappointed, eh?~
@1657 = ~Yes, chief?~
@1658 = ~Anomen and I?~
@1659 = ~Anomen.~
@1660 = ~Aerie and I?~
@1661 = ~Aerie.~
@1662 = ~Jaheira and I?~
@1663 = ~Jaheira.~
@1664 = ~Viconia and I?~
@1665 = ~Viconia.~
@1666 = ~Cernd.~
@1667 = ~Edwin.~
@1668 = ~Haer'Dalis.~
@1669 = ~Imoen.~
@1670 = ~Jan.~
@1671 = ~Keldorn.~
@1672 = ~Korgan.~
@1673 = ~Mazzy.~
@1674 = ~Minsc.~
@1675 = ~Nalia.~
@1676 = ~Valygar.~
@1677 = ~Yoshimo.~
@1678 = ~What did you think of Rieltar?~
@1679 = ~What did you think of Tamoko?~
@1680 = ~You liked Tamoko?~
@1681 = ~Was Tamoko prettier than me?~
@1682 = ~What did you think of Semaj?~
@1683 = ~What did you think of Winski?~
@1684 = ~What did you think of Davaeorn?~
@1685 = ~What did you think of Tazok?~
@1686 = ~You worked with Scar. What did you think of him?~
@1687 = ~Actually, never mind.~
@1688 = ~Don't tell anyone I told you this, chief, but Rieltar had a yen for the boys. A man's man. No surprise his son was adopted. Once or twice I thought I caught him looking at me, but maybe that's vanity.~
@1689 = ~Other than that, he was a tough, shrewd man. Ultimately not shrewd enough. He never suspected us until the very end... too full of himself.~
@1690 = ~Now there was a tight little package. You can't beat a Kara-Turan girl for... anything, really. But like I said, your brother got there first, and the dogs don't go in to feed until the lion's had his. Shame I never got a chance.~
@1691 = ~You hardly knew the man, did you? Before you cut him in twain. Suffice to say he was my friend and my teacher, and he's dead now.~
@1692 = ~Gods, chief, who wouldn't? She was not of this earth. But like I said, nothing came of it. We were friends, if anything.~
@1693 = ~Ah--no, <CHARNAME>, she was rancid. Did I say she was pretty? Well, maybe she was, but we never talked about much 'sides tactics and your damned brother. You've got more going for you than just your pretty face, chief.~
@1694 = ~The old fool. The poor old fool. He was no saint, but he had a father's love, and it would have broke your heart to see it--no matter how much you hated your brother. I suppose that's the cost of love. Happen that's why I never put much stock by it.~
@1695 = ~It just goes to show you appearances deceive. I met him a few times and thought he was civil enough, I never knew he used slaves. They told me he hired his workers--at cutthroat wages I assumed, but those were our dealings. I guess I should have known better, but I suppose if I knew better, I'd not be myself.~
@1696 = ~Ha! The dumb lout. He thought he was some kind of genius for a half-ogre because he could read and write, but he mispronounced every other word. You should have heard him say "supplies"--"supp-lee-ehs"--and all his men were too scared to correct him. It had your brother in stitches every time--at first, at least.~
@1697 = ~He was a good man, <CHARNAME>.~
@1698 = ~He'll make a good one yet if you train him properly. Start early and don't spare the rod. But in your dalliances, I'd take care--he looks the jealous type.~
@1699 = ~Heh, heh. Now we'll see if those Order sods are really celibate, eh?~
@1700 = ~Plenty more fish in the sea, m'lady, plenty more fish.~
@1701 = ~At least he's been in a fight. I don't care for his manner, but I can always pack my ears with cotton.~
@1702 = ~Sticking your hand down the serpent's craw, eh? Gods be with you, man.~
@1703 = ~Put out your hand--here. Calimshan Red Lotus skin balm. You don't get lucky tonight, I'll not be to blame, chief.~
@1704 = ~They come and they go. What can you do? She was a fine one, though. Guess this means she's available?~
@1705 = ~I wouldn't mind tapping that keg, let me tell you. Otherwise? What do you mean, otherwise?~
@1706 = ~Strangely, chief, hard as I try, I can't find a fault here. A half-elf. Brains, and years before she loses the looks.~
@1707 = ~You made at least one good pick, chief. Reliable, smart, and damned beautiful. Now if she'd just stop sheathing her quarterstaff up her rear.~
@1708 = ~If you don't mean all you say to her, I pity her. If do you mean it, I pity you.~
@1709 = ~It's working out, eh? I'm not sure what I think of this. If you break it off, let her down gently, eh?~
@1710 = ~She's not going to "lose it" now, is she?~
@1711 = ~I like a lass with a bit more meat on the bone, myself. Oh THAT's what you meant. Then I think she's about as much use to you as a hole in the head.~
@1712 = ~He's pretty well-spoken for a sod who turns into a damned giant wolf.~
@1713 = ~Heh, heh, I like him. He knows his business.~
@1714 = ~What good is a bard in a tavern? Plenty. What good is a bard on the field? None. End of discussion.~
@1715 = ~So this is the little girl we went to all that trouble for? Well... I suppose it was worth it. Clever and talented, she'll go far. Shame she loathes me, but I can't say I blame her.~
@1716 = ~Couldn't we just drop the yammering fool and keep his toys?~
@1717 = ~I have a lot of time for him. Don't let that one go, chief.~
@1718 = ~Point him in the right direction and he may be of use.~
@1719 = ~She's got a good strike range for a vital part of the human anatomy, I'll say that.~
@1720 = ~A space hamster? Why the hells not? Better a harmless madman than one stone cold sane.~
@1721 = ~Honestly, chief. You can do better than that.~
@1722 = ~Val-dono is a sharp one, chief, don't let him fool you. There's a saying in Kara-Tur: those who know, don't talk, and those who talk don't know.~
@1723 = ~A good honest rogue. He makes me feel like I was back home. You can't beat a Kara-Turan for swinging a sword, making love, or telling a joke.~
@1724 = ~It's a gods-damned shame, chief, but what can you do?~
@1725 = ~It was comfortable. I'm afraid I can't play the poverty card. I was surrounded by women and there was perfume and cushions everywhere; it was like having a hundred giggling sisters. And the customers were my uncles. Maybe that explains something, I'm not sure what.~
@1726 = ~Well, when the old lady was on her deathbed with the consumption, she told me... ~
@1727 = ~I'm kidding you, chief. She's still kicking as far as I know. Was young when she had me, now she must be... sixty-five summers, give or take one. She was a good worker and the owner pampered her. Every now and then I sent her a golder by courier. Last saw her not long before I packed off for the Gate. One of these days I should go home again, if I live to see tomorrow.~
@1728 = ~She never wanted me to get mixed up with the gangs. Well, how could I help it when half her clients had tattoos, and were always giving me sweets? I couldn't imagine anything finer back then. Anyway, she was almost glad when I left. The army seemed like good honest work after that, and she hustled me off with her blessing.~
@1729 = ~All things considered, she wasn't much of a mother. Still, useless is better than cruel or dead, and I still have a soft spot for the old girl.~
@1730 = ~Chief, they tell me I was born with a scowl and my hand on a tiny dagger.~
@1731 = ~Of course I was young, so I thought it was all very glamorous. Gold, women, lotus, everyone calling you 'brother'... but it was a bad game. Sods getting too caught up with their image of themselves, and most of them never got out, and a lot died young. I'd much rather be a freelance villain than ever go back to that.~
@1732 = ~Truth be told, I had quite a love for the lotus myself, in the day. If I hadn't seen what it did to the poor bastards I sold to, it might've carried me off.~
@1733 = ~I think you can probably guess. Let me just give you a piece of advice--no matter how fine she is, never, ever make a pass at your boss's wench.~
@1734 = ~There's but one overland trade route 'twixt East and West, chief, and you can bet the merchants have an eye for its safety. I had no trouble signing on as a caravan guard, and I had some of the nearer scrapes of my life; but it was nothing next to the army. I didn't know what I was getting into.~
@1735 = ~You have your merchant state without an army. Fighting is not a noble thing like in your old-fashioned monarchy. But they still need to cover their rears like everyone, and so they hire a gang of toughs off the street.~
@1736 = ~And they pay you, respect you, they love you. They invite you into their parlor and give you wine and listen to your stories, and go on and on about how if they weren't so old and rich, they'd love nothing more than to swing a sword along with you. But put one hand on their daughter's knee and it's a whole other story. Then it's swine, beast, murderer. No matter she was making mouths at you all evening. They want you on that field shedding blood for them and for that they'll let you in the parlor; but gods forbid in the bedchamber.~
@1737 = ~That's why I never went for the daughters. Damned for a copper, damned for a gold; I went for the wives.~
@1738 = ~What do you want to know?... Well, when you're speaking of Kara-Tur, there's Wa, Kozakura and Shou-Lung, and a few smaller nations too. It's Kozakura I'm from. The people of Wa and Kozakura are alike, and most of our culture we borrowed from Shou Lung--but as far as I'm concerned, we bettered it. I've found for convenience's sake, most of us will say we're from Kara-Tur and leave it at that.~
@1739 = ~As for the people... well, I've found most of them value family, manners, ritual and art. They have their own gods but there are many who worship yours. And really it's not so different. All over Toril you have greed, love, loyalty, hatred, and blind obedience to custom. But happen you went to Kara-Tur, you'd find the custom strict and rather strange.~
@1740 = ~Chief, in your dealings with the Throne, you found out all there is to know about Sembia. Living there just means you wake up to that every morning. The princes are merchants, the beggars are entrepreneurs and the thieves are attorneys.~
@1741 = ~I only knew it involved killing, and when the main of it came out, I assumed he wanted to finish what his father started--and reap the profits himself. Given what he'd become it seemed more than that, but what was I to believe?~
@1742 = ~But chief, if there's one thing that really shakes my bones, it's doppelgangers. I had never seen them before, and let me tell you, the atmosphere in the Throne those days--any halfway honest man was scared to death his best friend had been "replaced" in the night. I hope to never see one of those beasts again.~
@1743 = ~Yes, in a moment of rage. He threw it in my face like he thought I'd be impressed. I think I cracked a joke, and that made him angrier; I think I barely scaped with my life. But I didn't know what to make of it. I knew he wanted to kill his siblings, but not why. He told me I wouldn't understand--and happen he was right.~
@1744 = ~Aye... well. We've traveled some time now, haven't we? I suppose you might as well know all, as your path resembles more and more your brother's. Which is not to say you've made all the same choices. I'm referring to things out of your control, chief.~
@1745 = ~I just don't understand it. Sarevok had everything. Sure, he'd been raised by a loveless, violent bastard, and that probably seeped into his bones a little, but even Rieltar enjoyed the finer things in life sometimes.~
@1746 = ~He, your brother, had the love of a fine lass; a man, that old mage Winski, who loved him like a father; and Semaj and me who shared many a talk with him. Then little by little he started changing. Oh, he'd always had a cruel streak, but we all did; cruelty used to amuse him, and it was never much. The time came it didn't even amuse him. He started reading books, talking to men in cowls in monasteries out in the middle of nowhere, training more with the sword. Then he was cruel as a matter of habit. It's not that he got wicked, <CHARNAME>; he got serious.~
@1747 = ~It all makes me think he lied after all. About your dear father being dead and gone, I mean. Something came into him, something changed him, and if it wasn't a god or demon I don't know what it was. Raw power, if that's what we had, can't do that to you alone.~
@1748 = ~He started killing men and torturing them for fun, his father's lackeys. Not even for fun--for practice. He pulled away from Winski, it broke the old man's heart; and he stopped warming Tamoko's bed. Broke her heart too. I'd have been too glad to take over his duties, believe me; but when she came to me, practically in tears--tough girl like that--I hadn't the heart, chief. All I could do was pat her shoulder and say I didn't know about it. But at the same time he got more polite than ever toward his father... ~
@1749 = ~Gods! Look at the hour. How you get me running at the mouth like this, I'll never know. Some other time, chief. We have our own work to do.~
@1750 = ~Was there more? Oh... ~
@1751 = ~It isn't much, really. This is the part that touches on you, chief.~
@1752 = ~Your brother was not what you would call a wicked man, not in the least. He was very clean. He didn't drink or buy women. In his own way you could call him pious. He was single in mind and purpose, and he butchered men and women by the dozens.~
@1753 = ~The worse he got, the less he talked to me, so I hardly knew what was going through his head in those days. He vanished for days at a time and only came to us when he needed something done, and more often than not, it was dirty work.~
@1754 = ~To be honest, I still thought something good might come of it. That when he was some big king, us his lackeys would have it made. So I didn't ask too many questions.~
@1755 = ~From the start, he was more interested in you than in any of them, chief. He once said the others were like swatting flies; it would only be proper murder in your case. In a way he looked forward to it. And in fact, he was watching you more times than you probably knew. That nonsense with 'Koveras'--you didn't buy that, I hope--wasn't the only time you met face-to-face.~
@1756 = ~You know, I don't really think he wanted you hanged. I think he knew you'd escape. And truth be told... ~
@1757 = ~This will sound plenty strange, chief. But perhaps he even knew of his own death. In a way he embraced it. Kill or die, it didn't matter... that day in the Undercity... he just knew he was moving toward something big.~
@1758 = ~Chief... I don't want to talk about this anymore. Honestly, I get bad dreams sometimes. If you ever see your brother again, perhaps in the hells themselves, you can ask him yourself.~
@1759 = ~Put money in your purse, chief.~
@1760 = ~You realize this makes me the lackey of a lackey. I don't like to see you bowing and scraping, chief. Let's not get ourselves any further into hock.~
@1761 = ~Well, we'll find your girl, knock off your mage, then settle down to a life of ease and riches. No? Did I really think it would be that simple? Honestly, chief, I fondly wish so.~
@1762 = ~How many times I cursed the sun when I'd been in the cups the last night. Ah, how I miss that big yellow bastard now. Let's get out of here, chief.~
@1763 = ~I don't especially want to go up against that lady alone, but allies means splitting the gold and glory. We're all the ally you need, chief.~
@1764 = ~Can I talk you into buying a nice estate when this is all over? We could live like kings, is all I'm saying.~
@1765 = ~Ah yes. It might be fair to say he was more a cleric than a sorcerer. That was the power of the Hengeyokai, chief, the eight million gods of Kara-Tur. Now that's just a figure of speech, it means there are a lot of them. He said he had their favor, and so he did; perhaps not all eight million, but a few. There was a fox spirit in him from the looks of it.~
@1766 = ~Until now, I'd thought it was all superstition built around a few rogue magical beasts; but now I've seen it. Your gods have their own favored, I understand. Gods know why they picked him, but perhaps he had natural power, and they were drawn to it. The stories never make them out to be awfully moral. Gods are always interested in the powerful, as you should know, chief--rarely a benefit to the health of the powerful.~
@1767 = ~Woah-hoh! Sorry, chief, not my thing. Tried it once in prison, it didn't work for me.~
@1768 = ~(Angelo gives you a skeptical look.)~
@1769 = ~So you want it like that, do you? Well, I can't say I'm averse, but no thank you. Bite every gold piece and don't go to bed with your mistress; that's the rule. There's a reason in Cormyr they call it the "small death;" for the Big One oft follows on it.~
@1770 = ~What?!~
@1771 = ~You never know until you try, do you?~
@1772 = ~Perhaps... perhaps you are right. I forgot myself.~
@1773 = ~Smart, m'lady, I can see you aren't the type. I'm flattered, honestly, but don't let your youth gallop away with you.~
@1774 = ~This has been embarrassing for both of us, let's not speak more of it.~
@1775 = ~Playing the maiden? Then I beg pardon. But do the both of us a favor and try and deceive me all you like, but don't deceive yourself, m'lady. You know me for what I am.~
@1776 = ~All due respect, I'm not the man you want. A lass like you wants a man beside her, forever. For my part I stand behind you, and slightly to one side.~
@1777 = ~You would like that, truly? You would like to be treated as if I had bought you for a golder? Or as if at any moment we'd hear your husband's tread in the hall. Those are the only ways I know to treat a lady, m'lady. I'm an old hand at this but I could never be what you want.~
@1778 = ~But I do want that.~
@1779 = ~You are right, but... ~
@1780 = ~Angelo, I truly am interested in you.~
@1781 = ~Your mouth says, your eyes say different. Come the morning you'll wish you were dead--or more likely, wish I were dead. That's the way. Of course I'll be to blame for it; never your sweet self... Forgive me. I didn't mean to jest.~
@1782 = ~<CHARNAME>... look around you. Take a sniff. Feel the dirt. This is life. Things won't work out like you want. I've been on this clump of sod four-dozen years and I don't foresee waking up a new man tomorrow. No, I was born a bastard and I intend to die one. Find someone who was born a good fool and love him and marry him.~
@1783 = ~Truly? Truly, you say. M'lady, if you jest, the jest ends here. Don't tempt me too sorely. All that you imagine could take place--and I doubt but that the imagination would be bettered. I told you once I'm an old hand. But I tell you, if you have any idea of romance, hang it up with your shift in the closet.~
@1784 = ~Ehm. Well, let's see then...~
@1785 = ~Hey there, lass, how'd you like to help me count my ceiling tiles?~
@1786 = ~Pardon me, m'lady, might I make use of those two fine cushions to rest my tired head?~
@1787 = ~Are you by any chance a blacksmith, madam? I have a blade here could do with sharpening.~
@1788 = ~You look downhearted, lass. Happen our troubles oft don't look so bad, lying on our backs.~
@1789 = ~Pardon me, ma'am, are you the new drill sergeant? Happen you just made me come to attention!~
@1790 = ~I couldn't help but notice your most alluring legs, lass. They'd show off well on my shoulders here.~
@1791 = ~You have beautiful skin, m'lady. I'd like to see more of it.~
@1792 = ~You have beautiful skin, m'lady. Happen it would look better beaded with sweat.~
@1793 = ~M'lady, our lives are short and our bodies are warm. Why fight desire?~
@1794 = ~M'lady, have you ever seen the heavens? Happen I have, and I could take you there tonight.~
@1795 = ~Are you a collier, ma'am, have you a mount I could buy? No? Perchance I could ride you, then? Woah-hoh, that crossed the line, didn't it.~
@1796 = ~Yes, m'lady?~
@1797 = ~Angelo, when you trod on that man's foot by accident, you insisted he step on yours. What was that all about?~
@1798 = ~You mentioned dancing, Angelo. Well, are you ready for your lesson?~
@1799 = ~You told me you were superstitious. Now I notice you looking at the stars sometimes. Has that anything to do with it?~
@1800 = ~Angelo, how do you think of me? As a lover, a comrade? Both?~
@1801 = ~Actually, it was nothing.~
@1802 = ~Ah... superstition, chief. It's payback, you see. Keeps the evil eye away.~
@1803 = ~Surely you don't believe that nonsense!~
@1804 = ~I had never pegged you for the superstitious type, Angelo.~
@1805 = ~Ah, m'lady. Don't you notice I always pick up my glass with my left hand? I'm not left-handed, you know.~
@1806 = ~Thank you, m'lady. Truth tell, I was afraid you'd laugh.~
@1807 = ~Now... you know I've always had a wary relationship with the gods, mine or yours. But a man's got to feel as if he has some control of his life. I guess a thing like that is a scoundrel's prayer.~
@1808 = ~You should put your trust in a higher power. This will do you no good.~
@1809 = ~I know just what you mean. I never walk under ladders myself.~
@1810 = ~It can't do any harm, I suppose.~
@1811 = ~This is foolish, Angelo, we control our own fates!~
@1812 = ~I... know, but I just can't bring myself. Happen some god really does care about me, he'll just take pity anyhow.~
@1813 = ~Smart, chief. I knew a man walked under a ladder once, a bucket of paint fell on his head. He never was the same.~
@1814 = ~Aye, that's my thinking.~
@1815 = ~Do we now? Don't fool yourself, <CHARNAME>. We control a peasworth of what all happens to us, and you can't blame a man for wishing he controlled a bit more.~
@1816 = ~Now happen for years, it doesn't seem to make a difference. But if it makes a difference once, you can never be sure--you see? It's best to play it safe, I reckon.~
@1817 = ~I still say this is foolishness. I thought you were stronger than that.~
@1818 = ~Whatever makes you happy, I suppose.~
@1819 = ~I mean it. The gods frown on these antics.~
@1820 = ~Well, perchance you're stronger than I am, chief.~
@1821 = ~Hmm. Thanks.~
@1822 = ~I'm sure it's the least of what I do they frown on, <CHARNAME>.~
@1823 = ~Now if you get struck by a lightning bolt out of nowhere, don't say I didn't warn you.~
@1824 = ~Well, thanks for indulging my curiosity. We should be moving.~
@1825 = ~What else should I watch out for?~
@1826 = ~Well, go out in the cold and you'll take ill for sure. A healer swore up and down to me it wasn't the case, but I won't take any chances. When you see a raven looks bigger than most, and he looks you in the eye, you whisper "heavens have mercy on me." Don't cross back over a threshold right after you've come in, it'll mean trouble for you in that house. And never, ever step on a crack in the pavement.~
@1827 = ~But the customs from one land don't hold true in another!~
@1828 = ~You seem to have picked up quite a lot of them.~
@1829 = ~You've got me there, chief. But what can I say?~
@1830 = ~And every one true as gold.~
@1831 = ~Hmm. I will watch out for all of this, then.~
@1832 = ~Well, thanks... I think.~
@1833 = ~<CHARNAME>, at the end of the day, we're all a bunch of savages. However civilized we think we are. We deal with the world in any way we can.~
@1834 = ~What, here? Now?~
@1835 = ~I'm ready if you are!~
@1836 = ~Perhaps you're right, it was a silly idea.~
@1837 = ~Err, alright then... although I can't see what use it would be to us as we live now... but thank you, m'lady. Heh. You know it, then?~
@1838 = ~Of course, the ladies taught me in Candlekeep.~
@1839 = ~I've picked up a trick or two.~
@1840 = ~Oh no, I'm clueless. But it should be fun!~
@1841 = ~(lie) Yes, of course!~
@1842 = ~Ah... alright then, chief. I'll put myself in your hands.~
@1843 = ~Now stand like this...~
@1844 = ~Are you sure about that?~
@1845 = ~Now put your hand on my back...~
@1846 = ~Got it.~
@1847 = ~With tact and grace.~
@1848 = ~On my BACK, Angelo!~
@1849 = ~Just a little lower.--No not THAT much lower!~
@1850 = ~That's right, you've got it.~
@1851 = ~Eh-heh! Sorry, chief.~
@1852 = ~Now step... and step...~
@1853 = ~I live to serve.~
@1854 = ~Woah-ho! You sure you know what you're doing?~
@1855 = ~And step and step... and turn...~
@1856 = ~Woah-ho! This isn't so hard. Happen it would have been an asset to me a'times.~
@1857 = ~Uhp! Sorry about your foot there.~
@1858 = ~Now spin me! Spin!~
@1859 = ~Ha! Gods, my heart's beating...~
@1860 = ~Woah-ho--woah! Woah. I take it you weren't supposed to fall over like that. <CHARNAME>? Can you hear me? M'lady? Oh, gods...~
@1861 = ~Woah----ho.~
@1862 = ~(You execute a graceful spin and Angelo catches you in his arms and holds you close. You feel his heart pounding.)~
@1863 = ~Chief, that was... really something.~
@1864 = ~(Angelo suddenly pulls you into a deep, lingering kiss.)~
@1865 = ~(Although you are standing still, you still feel the world spinning around you as he keeps his lips pressed to yours, his body every inch against yours, and if you strain your ears you can almost hear music... )~
@1866 = ~Attari, chief, as they say--you've hit it.~
@1867 = ~You are the most ridiculous man! What have the stars got to do with us?~
@1868 = ~What do the stars tell you, Angelo?~
@1869 = ~Seen anything interesting recently?~
@1870 = ~Well, I was only curious. Enough of this.~
@1871 = ~Perhaps nothing. But it's how I was raised.~
@1872 = ~It's how I was raised, chief.~
@1873 = ~Outside the, ah, house of leisure where I grew up, there was an old fortune-teller used to practice his trade. Astrology is one of their tricks. Now that was no special chance, those frauds are everywhere; they're like the beggars here in Amn. Now I suppose you're wondering, if I call them frauds, why do I take any stock in it. Well I don't know.~
@1874 = ~Tell me about Kara-Turan astrology.~
@1875 = ~By all means, tell me about this nonsense.~
@1876 = ~I can't say I find this interesting.~
@1877 = ~Suit yourself, chief. You asked.~
@1878 = ~Well, first off, you've got your lucky and unlucky days of the week. The worst day of all is the one the great saint of the Way supposedly died on--and happen that's today. I wouldn't plan any business if I were you--not that I'd trouble you with such advice, if you hadn't asked.~
@1879 = ~I'll keep that in mind, what else?~
@1880 = ~Well, go on.~
@1881 = ~You are very foolish, Angelo.~
@1882 = ~Certainly, and I'll let you know when a lucky day comes around.~
@1883 = ~What, didn't you know that already?~
@1884 = ~Now they split up the years by a handful of the eight million gods, some of the bigger bugs. One year belongs to Inuchichi, the Father of Dogs; the next is for the Great Tiger, Daitora. So they go in a cycle. This year's the year of the Witch She-dragon, Ryubaba. Very auspicious if you happen to have been born in it.~
@1885 = ~Were you?~
@1886 = ~What's your sign, Angelo?~
@1887 = ~Pfffft.~
@1888 = ~I, ah, I was born...~
@1889 = ~(Year of the Rabbit.)~
@1890 = ~What was that? I couldn't hear you!~
@1891 = ~Ha, ha, ha!~
@1892 = ~Bah, as if it mattered.~
@1893 = ~Don't laugh, chief. The wild hare is a noble beast.~
@1894 = ~Now that I think about it it, it suits you.~
@1895 = ~What does that mean for you?~
@1896 = ~Su-ure it is.~
@1897 = ~Well, chief, it's got nothing to do with breeding like one. As for what it means, each fortuneteller will give you a different answer; but the one I remember is, a Rabbit is kind, shy and sensitive. He's a devoted friend but can be a bit touchy, and has to be reassured of affection.~
@1898 = ~Hah! Don't make me laugh!~
@1899 = ~Well, fair enough.~
@1900 = ~It does suit you, Angelo.~
@1901 = ~Here--(Kiss him.) Reassured.~
@1902 = ~Well, I didn't design it.~
@1903 = ~What's my sign?~
@1904 = ~Anything else?~
@1905 = ~Well, enough of this.~
@1906 = ~You think so?~
@1907 = ~Heh. Why thank you.~
@1908 = ~Let's see, given your age... hmm... years since I gave it much thought. I just wait for my year to come around...~
@1909 = ~Chief, you're a dragon. Bold, brilliant and talented. But a bit conceited at times. This is your year! Well, small wonder, then.~
@1910 = ~My year? Ha, ha! I am invincible!~
@1911 = ~Thank you, Angelo, I feel edified.~
@1912 = ~Ah, another day, more nonsense.~
@1913 = ~Hmm. Perhaps I shouldn't have let that slip.~
@1914 = ~Ah, anytime, chief.~
@1915 = ~Well, you asked, chief.~
@1916 = ~I suppose I know what you mean. You are both, yes. And it's strange. I would need a moment to sort it. Well, how do you think of me?~
@1917 = ~You know I never wished for this life. I wish we could be simply lovers.~
@1918 = ~I love you for your strength, Angelo. This life has brought us together.~
@1919 = ~Oh, I never give it any thought. I just wanted to see how your strange mind worked.~
@1920 = ~(sigh) There's something in that, to be sure.~
@1921 = ~Ha, ha! Well, let's see now.~
@1922 = ~Well... I still need a minute. Why did you ask, what are you getting at?~
@1923 = ~Could you truly accept your lover as your comrade?~
@1924 = ~When this fight is over, will we still have... what we have now?~
@1925 = ~The question just sort of popped into my head.~
@1926 = ~Well, if you can't give me a straight answer, then forget it.~
@1927 = ~I understand. Well... let me get one thing out of the way. As a warrior, as a commander, you're the equal of any man I've known. I'm not ashamed to serve you as a woman and I never was. But there is something more...~
@1928 = ~I understand. Yes, you wonder if they can be separated. And so do I.~
@1929 = ~I have my answer. You are something more than either a lover or a comrade to me, m'lady. I believe in our love but I do have to admit, if we weren't comrades, we would likely not be lovers. But you and I, <CHARNAME>, we couldn't be comrades without becoming lovers--I like to think.~
@1930 = ~As far as I'm concerned--with men, a true comrade who fights with you on the field... who you can always trust with your back... who'd take word home if you were killed. I don't know how it is with women warriors, but with men, that man's like a wife.--Now don't shoot me that look, heh. I said LIKE a wife. To take a girl to wife is the most you can do for her, and to be ready to die for a man is the most you can do for him. But just as I couldn't marry a man, I don't know if a woman could ever truly be that for me.~
@1931 = ~But we fight together, <CHARNAME>, and I trust you with my life... and hope that you trust me with yours. So, you're a comrade and lover both, and more than that.~
@1932 = ~There's a line in some old Kara-Turan epic, about the love between a hero and his friend being "greater than any love between man and woman." And that's our love. It's greater than any love I could have for man or woman, and it can't be put to a name.~
@1933 = ~... That sounded good, didn't it? I liked that.~
@1934 = ~Thank you, Angelo. I'm touched.~
@1935 = ~Yeah, right. Better luck next time.~
@1936 = ~You might have lost me, but... I understand your feeling.~
@1937 = ~(Kiss him.)~
@1938 = ~Well... gods, I'm embarrassed now. Forget I said anything.~
@1939 = ~Ha! I'll polish my oratory, then.~
@1940 = ~... Good. I'm glad, <CHARNAME>.~
@1941 = ~Mm. Mmmm.~
@1942 = ~Ask away, m'lady, ask away.~
@1943 = ~Who was your first kiss? Tell me!~
@1944 = ~Do you read, Angelo?~
@1945 = ~What's your favorite book?~
@1946 = ~Do you like music, Angelo?~
@1947 = ~Do you have a favorite tune?~
@1948 = ~Do you like poetry, Angelo?~
@1949 = ~Why are you so, err, fond of women?~
@1950 = ~Of all they places you've lived, which is your favorite?~
@1951 = ~Would you protect me no matter what?~
@1952 = ~Do you have a favorite food?~
@1953 = ~Do you have a favorite animal?~
@1954 = ~First... kiss? Gods, take me back, why don't you. My, ah, well. First kiss and first... everything, my "aunt" Ayaka.~
@1955 = ~Oh. Angelo.~
@1956 = ~Ah... really?~
@1957 = ~It got awkward, let me tell you. But there were three men in that house--the madam's old brother, a eunuch guard and me. Strange things were bound to happen.~
@1958 = ~Don't let anyone know, but sure as I'm alive, I could never stop myself. Used to sleep with a book under my pillow, trash or fine story of holy text; and I still enjoy a good one.~
@1959 = ~You know in Kara-Tur, they have these illustrated books. Don't breathe a word of this, swear it, but I always loved those. I'd hang around the bookbinders on the day the new title came out. They turned them out like hot rolls, trashy stories the most of them, about brave samurai and beautiful courtesans; but I gobbled them up. It made me feel like I was living a different life for an hour or two.~
@1960 = ~But there's a long, famous story about the great war between Wa and Shou Lung in Kara-Tur, written back when it happened. It has everything, chief, war and romance; I must have read it eight times. I remember it now: "Witness herein the fall of the proud. Remember that life is but a ripple on the surface of this world... " Ooh. Gives me the chills.~
@1961 = ~I like a good madrigal as much as the next man, <CHARNAME>, but I'm no bard. If I'm in the cups I'll sing along, happen I'll even try my hand on the lute. That never ends well for the lute.~
@1962 = ~Aye... heard it in the Gate first, as a matter of fact. A girl was singing it on the street. It made me damned sad to hear, and given my mood then... Well, it was called "The Last Rose of Summer," I think.~
@1963 = ~No. That's for the elves, far as I'm concerned.~
@1964 = ~Dirty hands shape the keenest minds, chief. I'm a man with a body like any other, and happen I'm bit more inclined that way than some men; but that's how the gods made me, heh.~
@1965 = ~But I'll forswear that. I'm fond of them now as far as they remind me of you... m'lady.~
@1966 = ~Well, I'll always love my home, but now that I've been away I think it's better to look at than live in. Too much custom and ritual. Half-breed that I am, I never completely fit in there, either. Some liked me for it, some hated me; but either way. As for Sembia, that's no place for a man to live. I've been to Calimshan and Waterdeep... in Calimshan the people are strange to me, I couldn't live there. Waterdeep... bad memories.~
@1967 = ~Happen Athkatla suits me well. They have a healthy respect for commerce, but they don't go mad over it; and they accept outsiders.~
@1968 = ~Would you like to live there?~
@1969 = ~What about the countryside?~
@1970 = ~Let's see where this business takes us first... dear one. Anywhere, just provided it's with you.~
@1971 = ~Once I staged an ambush on a farm that was some bandit's hideout. I was crouched down by the pigpens with a knife in my teeth. A goat bit me in the leg and a chicken sat on my head, enough said.~
@1972 = ~Never doubt it, <CHARNAME>. Any man or fiend looks askance at you, he'll have an issue on his hands.~
@1973 = ~Well... let me put it this way. I'm not scared of anything breathing; devils, dragons and the shambling dead are probably fine. But when the gods start coming after you, well, you're on your own, chief. Kidding!~
@1974 = ~You're a tough one, chief, make no mistake. But if you need a shoulder to lean on, or two good arms to hold you, just say the word.~
@1975 = ~Kozakuran rice liquor. What, that doesn't count? Well, anything I can get my hands on, but I've always been partial to mushrooms. Tastes just like meat when it happens you can't get any, which in the army happened often. Of course you've got to watch out for certain kinds, as many a scroll of Neutralize Poison cost me.~
@1976 = ~I've always had a soft spot for small, inquisitive Bhaalspawn.--Kidding, chief! I saw a tiger once in a zoo when I was a boy, and I've had a liking for them ever since. They're fierce, but if you watch them with their cubs, they're gentle as anything. I guess I admired that.~
@1977 = ~(Viewed from behind as he gives his back a vigorous scratching, Angelo is somewhat shorter than average for a human, powerfully built without being stocky. He is dressed in his customary leathers. From his sleeves escape tattooed flames, and when he lifts one of them to scratch his arm, you see a reptile's claw.)~
@1978 = ~(Out of habit Angelo returns a fantastically lascivious wink, before seeming to remember himself, coughing and looking off.)~
@1979 = ~(Angelo looks up from adjusting his scabbard and raises one eyebrow a shade. You can't help but notice, though, that his eyes follow you until you are well past.)~
@1980 = ~(Angelo, after regarding you for a moment as he might an enemy position, nods approval and grunts.)~
@1981 = ~(You straighten up to see Angelo looking pointedly in another direction. You might just be imagining a faint color in his cheeks.)~
@1982 = ~(Angelo starts and flails his arms; seeing you, he gives you a hurt look.)~
@1983 = ~(Angelo swats himself and mutters "damned flies and the damned southern climate...")~
@1984 = ~(You glance back to see Angelo calmly polishing his sword. You can't tell if he noticed or not, but his demeanor seems even sourer than usual.)~
@1985 = ~(Angelo grins, then smirks, then colors, then turns, then walks away. The next time you catch sight of him, he is squirming as if his leathers were too tight; but this does nothing to conceal the musculature quite visible within them.)~
@1986 = ~(You find yourself pinned to the ground, entangled with Angelo, who has you in some kind of complex hold. Before you can reflect that this is vaguely pleasant, he is helping you up as he apologizes roughly. "The last one who tried that on me, chief, was a greater doppleganger.")~
@1987 = ~(Before you can blink, you find yourself face-up on the ground, Angelo looking down at you with surprise and annoyance. As he helps you up and dusts you off, he mutters something about not surprising a man who served five years in the Devil's Mouth against the orcs.)~
@1988 = ~(In a moment, Angelo has your arm clenched between his own, prepared to snap it in half. "Gods, chief," he groans, releasing you, "I swear you don't need to test me.")~
@1989 = ~(Angelo turns his head and you taste his salty cheek. Giving you a puzzled look, he says: "What was that for? You want to reward me, give me a bigger cut of our next haul.")~
@1990 = ~(However, a moment later, you catch him humming softly to himself.)~
@1991 = ~(Angelo swats at his cheek as if he were stung and curses. After a moment, realizing what has happened, he blinks at you; then he half-smiles and turns away.)~
@1992 = ~M'lady...~
@1993 = ~Sorry, I can't find the words. But I don't think the time is right. Trust me, and... you will know more of this later.~
@1994 = ~But ye gods, it's not that I don't want to...~
@1995 = ~You follow in the hopes of retrieving something dear to you. I say that the longer you keep this up, the more you will lose.~
@1996 = ~Take this self-satisfied bottom-feeder, Angelo. You truly are a pathetic creature, <CHARNAME>, finding solace in the arms of a man old enough to be your natural sire. I would expect nothing less of you. Let us see how you fare when I remove this feeble prop, hmm?~
@1997 = ~I didn't want to come here. Let's find your sister another soul on the black market, I said. But would you listen? Oh, no.~ [adang808]
@1998 = ~Crack your feeble jests while you may. I have prepared a fate for you that will make your soul weep.~
@1999 = ~M'lady is twenty times your better. Do your-- ~ [adang809]
@2000 = ~Do my worst, did you mean to say? My dear man, you don't want to know what my worst is.~
@2001 = ~You have taken enough. You will return both Imoen's soul and Angelo.~
@2002 = ~Return Angelo to me and I will considering sparing your foul... un-life.~
@2003 = ~I would have hunted you for your theft of Angelo alone. He is very important to me.~
@2004 = ~Did you really think that taking something ELSE precious to me would make me less likely to destroy you? For Angelo alone I would track you to the ends of the earth.~
@2005 = ~It makes no difference to me. These tricks will not save you.~
@2006 = ~I found the taste of his blood most pleasing and exotic. You may find the results... surprising.~
@2007 = ~But see for yourself! I think you will agree I have... improved him. What do you have to say to your former "love", my pet?~
@2008 = ~Mistress, I will flay her skin from her muscle, strip her muscle from bone, split bone from bone, and crunch them for marrow.~ [adang810]
@2009 = ~(You place Angelo's body into the waiting arms of the statue and wait silently for a miracle. Nothing happens. He remains still and cold.)~
@2010 = ~(You can only remain silent in the face of bewildered looks from your companions. After several minutes, there is still no response.)~
@2011 = ~But... this just isn't possible. You were so sure it would work. I... sorry. I didn't mean to make it worse.~
@2012 = ~This smacks of the most unnatural. But unnatural afflictions may find unusual remedies. Perhaps you will say my counsel runs against that you gave to me, so long ago, but there may yet be a way to return him to life...~
@2013 = ~Fear not, <CHARNAME>, we will not abandon our search. There must be another who can aid us. For the present I will pray to Torm on his behalf.~
@2014 = ~This... is not a fitting end to the man. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@2015 = ~Were the old god's powers tapped in the end? A weak deity, like a weak man, deserves no homage. We will find you surer aid, abbil.~
@2016 = ~Greetings to you, honored customer. Might you wish to purchase items to ward against the unnatural and risen dead?~
@2017 = ~But of course.~
@2018 = ~Forgive me, but your speech and dress are strange. Where do you hail from?~
@2019 = ~Might I know your name?~
@2020 = ~Your friend here isn't very talkative.~
@2021 = ~I didn't think peddlers were allowed in the Temple District.~
@2022 = ~Do you know much of the dead? A Kara-Turan friend of mine is in peril.~
@2023 = ~Do you know much of the dead? My lover Angelo, a Kara-Turan, was attacked. Please, you must help me!~
@2024 = ~Might your charge's gift allow me to speak with... others?~
@2025 = ~Thank you for your help. Will you tell me now how you came to be in Athkatla?~
@2026 = ~You are more than welcome, my friend. I thought it nothing less than my duty.~
@2027 = ~As for the story, I suppose in the end, it is a simple one. The people of Kara-Tur reverence such arts as ours. Yet at the same time they are suspicious and simple. As you have seen, my young charge's gift is genuine; but a rumor spread that she was a fraud, and in the face of hatred we fled.~
@2028 = ~But it is my humble wish that we do good wherever we go.~
@2029 = ~And good you have done. Take this five hundred gold as a token of my gratitude.~
@2030 = ~Would you accept this hundred gold?~
@2031 = ~I see. Farewell, then.~
@2032 = ~You are most generous, lady. I would say that no fee is necessary, but this money will help us dearly in our mission. Blessings upon you, and farewell.~
@2033 = ~From the land of Wa, <LADYLORD>, in Kara-Tur. If you would now ask what brings us here... I am afraid it is not easy to speak of.~
@2034 = ~I am called merely Oyaji. The young lady beside me is my charge, and you may call her Sakaki.~
@2035 = ~I apologize on behalf of my young charge. As you may perhaps see, she has no sight, and so has withdrawn from the world of the living. Her traffic is only with the world of the dead. But forgive me for speaking of this, I would not wish to frighten you.~
@2036 = ~This is the truth. However, I have received permission from the High Watcher to do business here, as our mission is in accord with that of the churches--to guard the boundary line between the land of the living and the land of the dead.~
@2037 = ~I am afraid, most likely not. It is not she who finds the dead with her gift, but they find her. They find her who are still tethered to you--and most of those you have known have, it is likely, passed on to their rewards.~
@2038 = ~I would that she use her gift to bring the living peace, and nothing more. It is not good to the call the dead back once they wish truly to go.~
@2039 = ~Then you must lead me to him immediately.~ [adang812]
@2040 = ~He became a strange abomination. I had to kill him.~
@2041 = ~He became an awful creature! I was forced to cut him down myself!~
@2042 = ~I have his body here.~
@2043 = ~This is most grave. Then I must see the body.~ [adang813]
@2044 = ~This is strange work to do on the street, is it not? Try not to mind the stares. My charge and I are used to them. Now...~
@2045 = ~Mm. Indeed, it is exceedingly fortunate that we have met. Your friend has been attacked by a greater vampire, and his soul has been wrenched from his body with a violence we cannot imagine.~
@2046 = ~Ordinary methods of healing will have no effect. His soul has been claimed by the hells of his native land, and he must wander them even now; and if he was dear to you, he must call your name. Forgive me. I did not mean to increase your sorrow.~
@2047 = ~You must tell me of the vampire who brought this about. You may not be able to judge this, but of what degree of power was he?~
@2048 = ~Her name was Bodhi. She was once a powerful Elven mage.~
@2049 = ~Her name was Bodhi. She once held this city in a grip of terror.~
@2050 = ~Her name was Bodhi. She nearly killed me, I know that much.~
@2051 = ~This is not well to hear.~
@2052 = ~You... must forgive me. I do not believe he can be recalled.~ [adang814]
@2053 = ~I beg your pardon?~
@2054 = ~You shall aid me or feel my wrath!~
@2055 = ~No! Surely...there must be something...~
@2056 = ~I am wealthy and powerful! I can give you anything you want!~
@2057 = ~You must truly forgive me. I shall render you the only service I may. Sakaki, my little one? This young lady needs your help. Speak to Sakaki now, my friend. Perhaps you will at least find... release.~
@2058 = ~Speak to Sakaki now, my friend. Perhaps you will at least find... release.~
@2059 = ~Your friend told me that you could help me.~
@2060 = ~Let me speak to Angelo now! I beg of you!~
@2061 = ~Start talking, girl, and it had better be good.~
@2062 = ~(The young girl suddenly opens her eyelids, revealing startling, milky blind eyes. As you watch she begins to twitch and shudder. Suddenly a voice issues from her mouth, jarring your nerves even in the open street. The voice is the girl's, but at the same time it is familiar.)~
@2063 = ~Holla... chief.~
@2064 = ~Angelo! Angelo, speak to me!~
@2065 = ~It is I, my love. I am here.~
@2066 = ~Angelo, you get your sorry hide right back here this instant!~
@2067 = ~Angelo, thank the gods! You must tell me how to help you.~
@2068 = ~Chief... can't hear... so good. Head's gone. It's dark here.~
@2069 = ~Tell me where you are!~
@2070 = ~Tell me what I can do for you!~
@2071 = ~Is there anything you wish to tell me, Angelo?~
@2072 = ~M'lady, I... don't think I'll be seeing you again. It's far and it's dark. I almost can't see. <CHARNAME>. I think you should probably... forget about me. I've almost forgotten... about myself...~
@2073 = ~Angelo, I could never.~
@2074 = ~Idiot! As if I could!~
@2075 = ~Try to focus, Angelo. Focus on the sound of my voice.~
@2076 = ~I didn't make the rules... chief. That's... the way it goes.~
@2077 = ~Very well. If you wish to slip away from me, there is nothing I can do.~
@2078 = ~Angelo, no! I will not lose you!~
@2079 = ~... Chief?~
@2080 = ~Think of all we have shared, all we might still share!~
@2081 = ~You mean too much to me, Angelo. I will not let you go.~
@2082 = ~What? Did you think you could sneak away from the mighty <CHARNAME>, Bhaalspawn?~
@2083 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@2084 = ~His will to return is strong. And I see the grief written plainly on your face. My friend... there is a hope, but I hesitated before to mention it. It is in the power of the eight millions gods to return his soul--but you must put your own at stake. You must demonstrate before them your love, and if it is pure, they may look favorably on us. If they do not... I cannot speak of the consequences.~
@2085 = ~Do it.~
@2086 = ~Do it, please!~
@2087 = ~Actually, I'm having second thoughts...~
@2088 = ~Then sit here with me. We will prepare the body, and we will sit up the night chanting the blessed sutras. As I said before, pay no mind to the passers-by; the priests will not give us trouble. If you have companions who are willing to join us, please them to do so--it will lend us power.~
@2089 = ~AN-NA-MO-BA-GE-WA-DI-A-BA-LOU-MI-TA...~ [adang815]
@2090 = ~A-YOU-LI-A-NA-SU...~ [adang816]
@2091 = ~Wh-wh-wh...!~
@2092 = ~Praise be! Our prayers answered! Ah, in all my years I have hardly seen the like!~ [adang817]
@2093 = ~Who in the hells are you, old man? But--<CHARNAME>. Oh, gods. I feel as if... I haven't seen you in a long time.~ [adang818]
@2094 = ~Angelo!~
@2095 = ~Angelo, it's really you!~
@2096 = ~Well, it's about time.~
@2097 = ~Oh, all the gods and hells. I remember. I almost... no, I can't think of it. You have saved my life, m'lady, and I once again sought to take yours. Oh, gods. Come here. Let me feel you. This is too rich and too good to be the truth.~ [adang819]
@2098 = ~I'm happy just to have you by my side. Let's speak no more of this.~
@2099 = ~Well, it wasn't easy, let me tell you.~
@2100 = ~You gave me SUCH a scare! Never do that again!~
@2101 = ~It was nothing. I would have done the same for any of my comrades.~
@2102 = ~As you wish it.~
@2103 = ~And what sorry apologies I can offer, I do.~
@2104 = ~I'll... try my best, <CHARNAME>.~
@2105 = ~And I love you, m'lady, more than I can say.~
@2106 = ~Heh. That's my chief.~
@2107 = ~Thank you. Thank you all.~
@2108 = ~A-aww!~
@2109 = ~Hoorah! Drinks for all!~
@2110 = ~Well done, <CHARNAME>. You are a true heart indeed.~
@2111 = ~I certainly hope you shall go to the same lengths to rescue me, should I succumb, primate. (Hmm. Perhaps I should not have added that last part.)~
@2112 = ~Blessings upon you both, my friends. This is a glad day.~
@2113 = ~You should sit down and join us for a spell.  Everybody's welcome.~
