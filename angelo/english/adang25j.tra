@5    = ~Truly among the greatest romances e'er told is that between gentle <CHARNAME> and the dark one, the great mage and fearsome swordsman Angelo Dosan, who would once have been her executioner.~
@6    = ~My most humble thanks, most gracious sir. Again I apologize.~
@7    = ~(Hush, the apology's mine.)~
@8    = ~Angelo, what was that all about?~
@9    = ~Don't tell me...~
@10   = ~The, ah, damages. He was awfully shy about it but he was in the right. It came to fifty gold, he said, so I...took the liberty of paying the man. A drop in the bucket for us, eh?~
@11   = ~Well, I'm going to crawl off and die of shame now.~
@12   = ~Hee, hee, hee.~
@13   = ~I... can't say I regret it.~
@14   = ~Oh, don't be like that. We'll be a legend in this inn some day.~
@15   = ~Heh.~
@16   = ~Neither do I, m'lady.~
@17   = ~Good on you, I suppose. Show that lot up there what for, chief. Mayhap now I'll start praying!~ [adang128]

@24   = ~Mm, yes, let's.~
@25   = ~Not so fast! You are taking a bath!~
@26   = ~Angelo, would you like me to... wash that dust off?~
@27   = ~(Many-a-mile to...) *hem* Beg pardon.~
@28   = ~Err. Not that I'm averse, you understand. But perhaps...fight for our lives and all...some other day? Or I'll give myself a quick rinse, if you like.~
@29   = ~Don't lie to me! You'd just wet your hair and say you were done, wouldn't you!~
@30   = ~Angelo, I would like to bathe with you.~
@31   = ~Oh, come. You will enjoy this, I promise.~
@32   = ~Heh. Very well, then. We'll clean our bodies and dirty our minds, eh?~
@33   = ~Mm, yes indeed.~
@34   = ~We are married, you know. There is nothing dirty about it.~
@35   = ~Ah. You're right of course, m'lady. Old habits of talking are hard to break.~
@36   = ~Now let's see what arrangements can be made...~
@37   = ~Ah gods, but this takes me back. This here is Calimshite-style bathing, chief. Sit here in a hot room for a half-hour, then go a room over for a cold rinse, then if you've the coin, a massage.~ [ADANG000]
@38   = ~I visited Calimport with my old captain, Esim, and he saw to it us his officers were treated to one of these. I tell you it suited me fine. Though happen I'll never forget my disappointment when that burly, male masseuse walked in. Heh. This is new to you, eh chief?~
@39   = ~Yes, and I could get used to it!~
@40   = ~Yes. I feel like I'm being roasted alive.~
@41   = ~I'm sorry, did you say something? I was... distracted.~
@42   = ~Now in Kozakura, they throw all the men and women in one big bath with a curtain twixt them. Kozakurans are short, so it works well enough. But happen you get a foreigner, they're tall enough to see over the curtain. That creates... problems.~
@43   = ~Of course in the case of myself and, ah, my associates, there was a different problem. We'd come wading into the pool and the merchants and peddlers would see a wall of flames, dragons and demons coming at them. After that most of them cleared out, and we'd have the place to ourselves... Ah, sweet memory.~
@44   = ~Anyway it's cheap. But after a while, I tell you, it starts to turn into human soup. You're wise to get yours in early in the evening, if you catch my drift.~
@45   = ~I like these tales. Perhaps I'll see these lands some day.~
@46   = ~Somehow this is less arousing than I had imagined.~
@47   = ~Less talking, more flirting!~
@48   = ~Ah, I can picture it. <CHARNAME> and Angelo's bathing tour of Faerun.~
@49   = ~Chief, I know I've said it 'afore, but damn me if you don't look mighty fine unclothed. Like a marble statue of Sune.~
@50   = ~If Sune were a <PRO_RACE>, that is.~
@51   = ~Happen we could defeat our enemies if you took the field disrobed. Their eyes would melt out, or they'd swear allegiance on the spot.~
@52   = ~All a-shine with sweat like a thousand pearls. All leaning back, stretching your arms, batting your pretty eyes at me. Something you wanted to say, chief?~
@53   = ~Why don't you come take a closer look?~
@54   = ~You are a fair enough sight yourself.~
@55   = ~Oh, no, go on!~
@56   = ~Now much as my eyes aren't inclined to wander, I can't help but notice that sign overtop your shoulder...~
@57   = ~"Most Honored Customers: Please refrain from becoming affectionate in the steaming area. Humble thanks, proprietors." Shame, that. I suppose it will have to wait. Well, shall we be moving?~
@58   = ~Ah, gods, I owe you my thanks! I haven't felt this good in ages. Happen I don't dissolve in water, like a witch, after all. Pour out a bucket and I'll give my girl a scrub.~ [ADANG000]
@59   = ~Yes, please!~
@60   = ~Only if you promise to let me return the favor.~
@61   = ~Oh no, you first! I see grime on you that hasn't been touched since you joined the army, I'll bet.~
@62   = ~And so we get a lather going... and so... and so... gods, you wouldn't know it to look at you, but you've picked up your share of the dirt. Woah, woah! Nothing meant! You just never imagine an angel needing a bath.~
@63   = ~There we are now, <CHARNAME> all neat and clean, ready to face another day of hacking away at undead and stinking abominations.~
@64   = ~My turn!~
@65   = ~Ah. Thank you, Angelo.~
@66   = ~I give you my word, chief.~
@67   = ~Heh, heh, fair enough. Be gentle with me though... Ouch! Watch the hair, you need a more ladylike touch.--Joking, joking. Ahh. Don't stop.~
@68   = ~Your turn!~
@69   = ~You're welcome.~
@70   = ~M'lady, you're overflowing with sharp ideas. I swear I'll never resist you again.~
@71   = ~(sigh) I'd just as soon not leave this room. You know what I mean. But deeds of glory won't do themselves. Shall we resume our clothes, and to bed?~
@72   = ~Yes, let's.~
@73   = ~(sigh) Yes, I suppose we must.~
@74   = ~Hold on. Didn't you say something about a massage?~
@75   = ~And so life rolls on. But still, there'll be a place in my heart for the memory, <CHARNAME>...m'lady. Thank you.~ [adang807]
@76   = ~That is the usual amenity, but it would seem they don't have the staff. Happen our dear friend Balthazar's tax reforms have cut into their business.~
@77   = ~That's a shame. Well, to bed, then.~
@78   = ~*cough* That's not exactly what I meant. Hint, hint.~
@79   = ~Woah-ho! Well, now. But I can't help but notice another sign on yonder wall: "Most Honored Customers: We ask you to restrain your affections in the bathing area. Humble thanks..."~
@80   = ~(Draw close.) What sign? I don't see any sign.~
@81   = ~(Pose.) Where are your eyes, again?~
@82   = ~(Pounce.)~
@83   = ~Yes, I... suppose we wouldn't want to upset them.~
@84   = ~Ah, yes, I... now that you mention it I... don't see any sign ei... ther...~
@85   = ~Ah. Eyes. Yes. Well, now.~
@86   = ~...!~
@87   = ~M'lady. I have an errand to run. Beg pardon, I won't be gone long, I swear.~
@88   = ~At a time like this? Are you joking?~
@89   = ~Are you sure it can't wait?~
@90   = ~What on earth could it possibly be?~
@91   = ~Of course, Angelo.~
@92   = ~I... there's something I've got to take care of, that's all. Can't wait. Very urgent.~
@93   = ~Have you lost your mind!? Under no circumstances!~
@94   = ~I'm coming with you.~
@95   = ~Very well, will you find me? Or where can I find you?~
@96   = ~I understand. Go.~
@97   = ~Got to do it alone, it's a... male thing. (Gods, that doesn't sound right. No one would look at me twice if I said it was a "female thing.") I swear I won't be but a minute. I, ah, see an inn yonder, I'll wait for you in there.~
@98   = ~Well, don't think I'll bother looking for you!~
@99   = ~(sigh) Very well, but I can't say I like this.~
@100  = ~I get the feeling you don't trust me, Angelo.~
@101  = ~I told you it's fine! Get going already!~
@102  = ~Sorry, chief.~
@103  = ~(You hear a piercing woman's scream from inside the temple of Waukeen.)~ [adang000]
@104  = ~Looks like trouble, chief. Let's go check it out... I have a bad feeling about this.~ [adang049]
@105  = ~<CHARNAME>, I've deceived you. I've taken you in like a Calimshite trader. But... but hear me out.~ [adang050]
@106  = ~(Angelo drops down on one knee.)~
@107  = ~<CHARNAME>... chief... you're more to me than all the emeralds of Sembia, all the rubies of Thay; more than a hundred thousand gold. I love you. I... want you to be my bride.~ [adang051]
@108  = ~Gods, if anyone who knew me could see me now, how they'd laugh... ! But I won't put a fine point on it. I would follow you as your lackey, your dog, if you wished it, forever; but if you care for me, swear these bonds, and so will I. And if I ever kept a promise in all my life I'll be true. Whatever little I have is yours, and I'll have no dowry but your hand.~ [adang052]
@109  = ~I said I won't put a point on it. I'm old and I'm weak and I'm scared of dying and I'm scared of dying alone. This is another coward's ploy to bind you, but such ploys are all I know. I won't deceive you...~ [adang053]
@110  = ~If you hesitate a moment, <CHARNAME>, turn me away. It would kill me, but it would be fair recompense for all the evil I once meant you. I planned to kill you, and now again I am at your mercy, and I would not blame you if you let the axe fall. But...~ [adang054]
@111  = ~Gods, how I love you. I'm not ashamed.~ [adang055]
@112  = ~I, ah, you see I put some grease in my hair. It kind of got stuck down on one side. Polished my boots, too. Bet you can see your face in them. Your, ah, pretty face, <CHARNAME>. Sorry, I told you I'm no good at this.~
@113  = ~But from that I know, and I hope you know, love, I'm in earnest. It's easy to sweet-talk where your heart isn't.~
@114  = ~<CHARNAME>. As I am, will you have me?~
@115  = ~Are you joking? This is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. Yes! Yes!~
@116  = ~Yes.~
@117  = ~Perhaps I would have, but with this showing, you just spoiled your chances.~
@118  = ~Angelo, this is much too soon!~
@119  = ~I'm sorry, Angelo. I'm touched, but... I just can't.~
@120  = ~Chief... I know. But with the lives we lead. Everything happens quick with us; gods know it has to. On the road day in, day out, one fight after another? Hate to put it this way... but who knows if we'll live to see tomorrow?~
@121  = ~And I can't fight in a state like this. It puts me all out of sorts. It goes on like this, happen it would be my death.~
@122  = ~I'm weak. I can't wait. I have to be sure of it. I told you I'm a rogue and a coward. I have to feel... safe.~
@123  = ~I understand. I will marry you.~
@124  = ~My love... I am yours.~
@125  = ~No, Angelo, I cannot do this. I am sorry.~
@126  = ~Are you insane? This is impossible!~
@127  = ~I can't beg you, <CHARNAME>. That would just make it worse. But are you certain?~
@128  = ~Well... perhaps... no, Angelo. I have reconsidered. I will.~
@129  = ~Then you just made me the happiest whoreson on the face of Toril, m'lady.~
@130  = ~I, ah, I took the liberty of letting a few of our comrades in on the plan.~
@131  = ~Dry your small eyes, Boo! We must be men! This is a happy day for our comrade <CHARNAME>!~
@132  = ~Ach, if I'd known ye was such a simple touch, I'd of taken a shot meself!~
@133  = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, at the moment I find myself at a loss for words to express my contempt and hilarity. Give me but a moment to think on it.~
@134  = ~Hee-hee. A stunt like this is almost enough to make me like him. Maybe you'll be pulling duty at mine in a few years, huh?~
@135  = ~Reconsider, <CHARNAME>. Surely you cannot fail to see this man for what he is.~
@136  = ~You have come such a long way, my child. I... am proud of you.~
@137  = ~When we first made this rogue's re-acquaintance, I would have barred such a union with my staff; but he has humbled himself in this to my amusement, and I see the truth of your feeling in your eyes. Truly the works of nature are strange...~
@138  = ~Forsooth, such binding of souls is passing strange to me; but if make you happy then fly to it, my raven. Give Haer'Dalis but a kiss first, no?~
@139  = ~You know, I like this. When my mother married my father, they probably spent enough gold to make all the beggars in Athkatla princes.~
@140  = ~In truth, I like this well. It shows a will most right and reformed on the part of yon gallant. Go to it, <CHARNAME>.~
@141  = ~You're really brave, <CHARNAME>. I mean, both to get married, and to get married to... that.~
@142  = ~A strange turn of nature, it is, when the winter endeavors to kiss the spring.~
@143  = ~So, you have snared the jaluk in the end. Good luck go with you, you will need it.~
@144  = ~In truth, I could never marry myself; but if it suits you, <CHARNAME>, I wish you luck.~
@145  = ~There now, why can't we do this sort of thing more often?~
@146  = ~<CHARNAME>, your friend came to me, trembling like a schoolboy. Not until he drew closer, and the candlelight fell on his brow, did I see him for a grown man! I told him I was more than happy to assist his design, and so I will.~
@147  = ~What can I say... ? I never thought such was possible in this world of rogues, this jailhouse. And if I had thought it was... I might have lived my life differently... <CHARNAME>... forgive me. It's the accursed dust here, from the catapult... my eyes... that's all. I'm not finished yet; I'll never weep.~ [ADANG000]
@148  = ~ Friends, we are gathered in this place to bind this man Angelo and this maid <CHARNAME> in bonds of unending love and fidelity, under the eyes of Waukeen.~
@149  = ~Ah, this reminds me of my dear cousin Tilly's wedding. Now it happened to take place on an airship, you see, because the fellow was... what, why is everyone glaring at me?~
@150  = ~What, you holy gods, have you nothing to say? Would you punish wickedness but not such foolery?~
@151  = ~Let us commence the ceremony.~
@152  = ~(Gods, Angelo, I feel like I'm swearing a geas.)~
@153  = ~Go on, good mistress.~
@154  = ~(say nothing)~
@155  = ~Wait! I... I can't.~
@156  = ~(Honestly, <CHARNAME>? I know what you mean, but I'd not have it otherwise.)~
@157  = ~I object, priestess! While this man is my comrade, he is no fit husband for gentle <CHARNAME>! He is a drunkard and a violent man, and I have no doubt she will be ill-treated in this union!~
@158  = ~I can take care of myself, Anomen.~
@159  = ~You are being unfair to him, Anomen.~
@160  = ~I appreciate your concern, my good knight, but this is the man I love.~
@161  = ~This is true. Angelo... I am sorry.~
@162  = ~<CHARNAME>, if ever you... no. I have said nothing. I will hold my peace.~
@163  = ~May the eye of Waukeen look favorably on us today! Do you, Angelo Dosan, take this lady in sickness and in health, in wealth and in poverty, to be your sacred bride?~
@164  = ~(Hells.) I do, mistress.~
@165  = ~ Let it be so recorded in the books of the heavens. Do you, <CHARNAME>... Bhaalspawn? Oh dear, I might have expected as much.~
@166  = ~(Psst! I thought I told you not to go with that; use the other one!)~
@167  = ~ Ah, yes, I disordered my notes in this haste. Do you, <CHARNAME> Gorionson, take this man in sickness and in health, in wealth and in poverty, to be your sacred husband?~
@168  = ~I... I'm sorry, Angelo. I can't say it.~
@169  = ~I do, mistress.~
@170  = ~Ha ha! I can't believe it really got this far! It was a big joke all along, Angelo! Ha, ha, ha!~
@171  = ~Then the vow is made. In Waukeen's name I bless this union; may it be happy and fruitful as its persons wish. Angelo, you may now seal the vow.~
@172  = ~What?~
@173  = ~(You may kiss her now.)~
@174  = ~Ah. Right. Holla, chief--here's for you.~
@175  = ~(Alright, give me that thing... ) And this is yours. An old professional souvenir.~
@176  = ~Oh...~
@177  = ~Thank you, Angelo.~
@178  = ~Because I love you, I'll forgive you this, Angelo.~
@179  = ~Angelo and <CHARNAME>, I do hereby pronounce you husband and wife.~

@251  = ~Ama-tan was grandmaster for a spring and a summer. I'm sure you've gathered by now that he was as stupid as he was powerful, and he left a messy house behind. The captains were none too happy under a boy grandmaster, but since he'd killed old Souya they had no choice; and if he had stayed to clean things up, he might have lasted. But first thing he ran off chasing his wonderful dream, and you know how that story ended.~
@252  = ~I came back to find old Souya's brother, Kagawa, in charge. They'd just been taking orders from a boy and they certainly weren't about to take them from a girl. So much for being grandmaster. After three days of being kicked and spit on, Kagawa said he'd let me run off like the bitch-dog I was; or he'd let me back in if I brought him one thing... ~
@253  = ~Ama-tan's finger.~
@254  = ~What!~
@255  = ~Sounds reasonable.~
@256  = ~Eeeeew.~
@257  = ~Ama-tan and I were assassins to old Souya. The first time Ama-tan raised his head, Souya came down on him, and he had to cut off the top joint of his little finger as punishment. When Ama-tan killed him, he took the finger back. It galled him to lose a part of his body, he thought that much of it.~
@258  = ~I know he kept it in his chests. But back there, I wasn't thinking. My only hope is that a certain... someone might have thought to bring it along with them... ?~
@259  = ~Forget about you, what does Kagawa want with it?~
@260  = ~Why on earth would I carry a lump of dead flesh around with me?~
@261  = ~I'm sorry, I don't have it.~
@262  = ~I have it right here.~
@263  = ~To feed it to his cats, I imagine, he hated Ama-tan that much. But we live in a world of symbols. Things like that mean a lot.~
@264  = ~A trophy? I know I have a few of the same. Or perhaps you just thought it might be of use some day... ?~
@265  = ~(sigh) Then it seems I've made the journey for nothing. They say you can't go home again. Well, thanks for your time; I'll make my way somehow.~
@266  = ~Not bad by half! I knew I could count on you.~
@267  = ~Will you give it to me?~
@268  = ~Take it, please. I've no use for it.~
@269  = ~Not so fast. What's it worth to you?~
@270  = ~Not so fast. I like to make people suffer. I think I'll just keep it.~
@271  = ~Sorry, I won't get involved in these criminal dealings.~
@272  = ~I was just kidding. Ha, ha!~
@273  = ~For you, my dear? Anything.~
@274  = ~Perhaps we could work out another form of payment. One not involving clothes?~
@275  = ~Why... thank you. I'm unused to such generosity. You're a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>.~
@276  = ~There's something you ought to know.~
@277  = ~I thought it would come to that.~
@278  = ~Oh, please, m'lord, let's not mix business and pleasure.~
@279  = ~<CHARNAME>, you're so freakishly powerful you've no use for the few coins I could give you, and I have no magic trinkets to spare. All I can give is information--I have a piece of information that might interest you. If you wouldn't just do a poor girl a favor, that is.~
@280  = ~Well, take it, then. I have no use for it.~
@281  = ~Very well, information it is. I'm short of that these days.~
@282  = ~I changed my mind, you'll not have it.~
@283  = ~I do not have it, Suu. I am sorry.~
@284  = ~Thank you. You really don't know what this means to me. One man's ounce of carrion is another's lifeline. Well then, as promised... ~
@285  = ~Ginpachi is coming for you. If you were a Kara-Turan, and perhaps with a touch less godly strength than I see you have, that would be enough to put the fear of Heaven in you. As it is I'll explain.~
@286  = ~Ginpachi is a master ninja, one of the Six Guardians of the Imperial Police, and he's known as Peace--what you have, I understand, after he slits your throat. Most don't even know the names of the Guardians, but in my profession you pick things up. I think you're a match for him, but you'd do well to prepare yourself. Don't let him catch you wounded or unawares. Even you, <CHARNAME>, should beware of a Guardian; and he may have Lady Kaede along with him--she's called Empty, supposed to mean you can't hit her.~
@287  = ~But what does he want with me?~
@288  = ~Thank you for the warning, and I shall most certainly beware.~
@289  = ~Thank you for the warning, but I won't lose any sleep over this.~
@290  = ~What a gyp! Is that all?~
@291  = ~Of course, the sword. That damned useless relic.~
@292  = ~I see. Well, he'll not have it.~
@293  = ~I have no further use of it, I would give it to him if he asked.~
@294  = ~That thing? But I'm afraid I've lost it.~
@295  = ~That thing? Oh, I sold it.~
@296  = ~Smart.~
@297  = ~As you would, then.~
@298  = ~I'm afraid so. I'd think your life would be a fair price for half a finger.~
@299  = ~I have confidence in you, <CHARNAME>.~
@300  = ~The time for asking is past. A man like Ginpachi asks once, as I assume he did. And after that... ~
@301  = ~How in the hells could you LOSE a sword? Well, he couldn't know, he'll find you just the same; and I'm afraid there'll be no chance to explain.~
@302  = ~You SOLD the Hand of the Gods? It was priceless. Well, he couldn't know, he'll find you just the same; and I'm afraid there'll be no chance to explain.~
@303  = ~A pleasure as always. Then if we've no further business, I suppose I'll be going... ~
@304  = ~Wait a second. How do you mean to get out of here?~
@305  = ~Good luck, then.~
@306  = ~Good riddance.~
@307  = ~Wait. Why go back? Why not turn over a new leaf?~
@308  = ~Why such a rush? Have a drink, on me.~
@309  = ~I'm a living shadow, <CHARNAME>. I'm confident I can slip out somehow. But if it comes to that... that's the life of a criminal. One moment you're breathing, the next--all darkness. I came to terms with that long ago.~
@310  = ~Good luck, then, and take care of yourself.~
@311  = ~My pleasure. Farewell, then.~
@312  = ~Now... didn't you say it was a shame we couldn't get to know each other better?~
@313  = ~And to you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@314  = ~Aw. But I'll miss you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@315  = ~It's too late for that, I'm afraid. Well... you take care, now.~
@316  = ~Mmm. Why thank you kindly, m'lord. Cheers!~
@317  = ~Ah, m'lord. I say many things.~
@318  = ~(leaning closer) I would like to know you better.~
@319  = ~Fare you well, then.~
@320  = ~As would I, I confess, but this hardly seems the time or place to pour out our hearts. No?~
@321  = ~The sort of "knowing" I mean would take a night at the most.~
@322  = ~Perhaps not. Fare you well, then.~
@323  = ~What do I have to say to get you into bed!~
@324  = ~I see.~
@325  = ~And it's knowledge I'd say we should both profit from.~
@326  = ~Oh, you tease, get you gone!~
@327  = ~Oh... something of greater subtlety than that. Farewell, m'lord.~
@328  = ~Ha! Well, then. See you retire alone tonight, and around the midnight chime, you may have a new experience. I trust there will be no jealous lovers... ? But see to it. I am, in any case, most discreet. And that is the least of my skills. You'll wait for me? Am I excited? Oh, this is too ridiculous... ~
@329  = ~Truly... m'lord, I'm glad. I'd hoped you would speak. I sleep alone too often.~
@330  = ~(You blink, and find Suu sprawled full-length beside you, grinning.)~
@331  = ~M'lord. And I trust the night finds you well?~
@332  = ~(She begins to undress.)~
@333  = ~Wait!~
@334  = ~Well enough, now! Let's get to it.~
@335  = ~Mm, indeed. Do give the word if it gets... too much for you? I think a muffled scream, at the least, should suffice.~

@343  = ~What game is this? Hmph! If you wish it.~
@344  = ~(sigh) This theme again? Really, we haven't the time... It's not that I don't like to talk. But I've told you already what there is to tell.~
@345  = ~Sweet nothings, eh? M'lord, I AM a sweet nothing. Point of fact, I couldn't describe myself better. Shall we get to it?~
@346  = ~I am tool to serve a job. At the moment there is no hand to turn me, so I amuse myself. And so I wanted to do tonight, nothing more.~
@347  = ~Do you enjoy your life?~
@348  = ~Did you ever wish for different?~

@351  = ~Suu... I can't do this.~
@352  = ~I see. Shall we get to it?~
@353  = ~What kind of question is that? We suck what fun we can from the dish fate deals us. What more is there?~
@354  = ~If wishes were horses, <CHARNAME>, beggars would ride.~
@355  = ~What for? Another warm body? But I have that right now. What more is there?~
@356  = ~Seventeen summers, I would reckon. What's that to do with anything?~
@357  = ~Why not?~
@358  = ~I can't betray my lover, after all.~
@359  = ~I just don't feel like it anymore.~
@360  = ~This isn't what you need, Suu.~
@361  = ~Hells, I came here for a tryst, not a sermon! What are you talking about?~
@362  = ~You are too young. It wouldn't be right.~
@363  = ~You are living a misery, and I can't assist you.~
@364  = ~Won't you... let me help you instead?~
@365  = ~On second thought... let's just get to it.~

@368  = ~I never had a choice, <CHARNAME>, and I've no choice now. This is the life I know. But so be it. Thank you in any case... for your company. Fare you well.~
@369  = ~Help? And what sort of help could you offer, Bhaalspawn? You can barely help yourself... no, forgive me. But so be it. Thank you in any case... for your company. Fare you well.~
@370  = ~You... what? No. You don't know what you're talking about, you... ~
@371  = ~I have to get out of here. This is wrong, all wrong. But I... thank you... perhaps we'll meet again, some day, I...~
@372  = ~Fare you well.~
@373  = ~(When you wake, there is no sign that Suu was ever there.)~ [adang000]

@384  = ~("Most discreet", my foot!) Err, Aerie, wait...~
@385  = ~ <CHARNAME>. How... ? But... if you are truly sorry... oh, let's forget about this! The thought is almost too much. Only swear it, swear it will not happen again...~
@386  = ~I d-don't believe you.~
@387  = ~Oh. I see it in your eyes, you speak true. I... do not understand, but thank you. You are a good man, as I thought.~
@388  = ~<CHARNAME>. How could you? I don't understand...~
@389  = ~I, I can't allow this. This is too cruel. I... can't be with you, <CHARNAME>.~

@401  = ~(sigh) I suppose you are young, and given to such pranks. If you are truly sorry I will forgive this. But do not think I will overlook it a second time! Do not value me lightly, <CHARNAME>; we know each other too well for that.~
@402  = ~Another lie? Do you think I am so easily taken in?~
@403  = ~Wait--no! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Please, please, please... *gasp* please! It will never, ever happen again, I swear it!~
@404  = ~Well... err... come on now, be reasonable... ~
@405  = ~Fine, then.~
@406  = ~... I see you are telling the truth. I do not understand what has happened, then, but... thank you. Let us continue as before.~
@407  = ~What? Ingrate! And after all I have given you, sacrificed for you. How dare you? It is almost too much to bear. Get out of my sight, <CHARNAME>.~
@408  = ~Get. Out. Of my sight!~
@409  = ~By Silvanus, what have we done?~
@410  = ~Do not think I have been deceived, jaluk. But with a mere slip of a girl? Have you grown so tired of me, or did you hope to provoke my jealousy, hmm? In any case I will overlook it this once. I do hope you enjoyed yourself.~ [adang000]
@411  = ~...~
@412  = ~But this is all wrong, Dosan! The skin should be greasier, the eyes more sallow. And you are not nearly so tall.~
@413  = ~And <CHARNAME> cuts a finer figure in that armor than ever you did, my friend.~
@414  = ~Chief, that's a Kara-Turan sword stance the drow's struck. I don't know how he came by it, but I've dealt with the sort. Why don't you let me handle this?~
@415  = ~Then he's a disgrace to his title. A general puts the lives of his men and his charges before his own, mercenary or no.~
@416  = ~I think we can do this, chief. I once took a gambling house with four men and a lookout. Replace the guards with golems and the customers with demons or gods know what, and I still like our odds.~
@417  = ~Woah-ho! Back that cart up so I can take another look! Tell me, m'lady, when did Lady Sune bed your father?~ [ADANG160]

@419  = ~I honestly wish I could say I saw this coming.~
@420  = ~It's up to you. Honestly, I don't see the point. What more could you want than gold, fame and love? And you can have all of those as a mortal. Being a god seems... lonely, <CHARNAME>. And... truly... I've gotten used to your carcass.~
@421  = ~Happen you want it, though, I'm sure the heavens will never be the same.~
@422  = ~All the power of a king and all the self-righteousness of a monk. A bad combination, if you ask me.~

@425  = ~A dragon. Perfect. I... hate... dragons!~

@432  = ~I gave my word, didn't I? I'd stand by you till the end. Well, mayhap I didn't say it quite like that, but it was implied. Happen you take off now... what happens to our agreement?~
@433  = ~You were never bound, Angelo. You were free to come and go as you liked.~
@434  = ~The agreement is dissolved. This is the end... at least of something.~
@435  = ~The agreement is dissolved. The terms, if you'll recall, were "until the end," and the end is here.~

@443  = ~M'lady, <CHARNAME>, you're about to see a man beg.~
@444  = ~Ha, ha, ha! Could you sink any lower, Dosan?~
@445  = ~No, Sarevok. No lower.~
@446  = ~<CHARNAME>, on my knees. You are the most precious thing I ever knew, and you colored rose a whole wasted life. Don't leave me. I can't offer you anything but myself. Stay.~
@447  = ~Ha, ha! Ha-ha-ha, ha ha!~
@448  = ~Shut up, Sarevok!~
@449  = ~He knows I mock at him. He would mock himself in his heart were I not here.~
@450  = ~Don't you want my happiness, Angelo?~
@451  = ~I am sorry. No.~
@452  = ~Ha, ha! I can't believe you swallowed it! It was all for this moment, Angelo... my revenge.~
@453  = ~Ha, ha! I can't believe you swallowed it! It was all for this moment, Angelo... I just felt like crushing you.~
@454  = ~This doesn't become you, Angelo.~

@457  = ~But this is me.~
@458  = ~... ~
@459  = ~He waited too long, the old fool, he should have attacked while we were still weak. Looks like you've made another powerful enemy--but I doubt even the Emperor could stand against you now, chief.~ [ADANG000]

@461  = ~Plan?~
@462  = ~A full frontal attack, what else?~
@463  = ~I don't like the numbers. We'll sneak around and thin them out.~
@464  = ~In and out. If we can remove Yaga-Shura, their ranks should crumble.~
@465  = ~As soon as I feel like telling you, you'll be the first to know.~
@466  = ~(sigh) Chief, chief, chief.~
@467  = ~Good on you, chief. I see I have nothing to be concerned about.~
@468  = ~Bold, if you can manage it. Have you thought this through?~
@469  = ~I am powerful beyond all reckoning, Angelo! Who could stand in my way?~
@470  = ~I trust in fate. Things have always worked out.~
@471  = ~I trust in the gods, they will watch over me.~
@472  = ~Do you have a better idea?~
@473  = ~Never ask, never listen. You're starting to remind me of someone.~
@474  = ~Haven't most of your enemies said the same thing? And where are they now?~
@475  = ~And if the wheel of fate turns against you?~
@476  = ~The gods help those who help themselves, as they said in the Gate.~
@477  = ~Chief, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's suicide. You've got the power of an army here. But army against army, you still need tactics. I would sit down two nights, if not a week, to plan an engagement like this.~
@478  = ~Angelo, we don't have that kind of time.~
@479  = ~I told you, the mountains themselves should be trembling before me!~
@480  = ~Perhaps you are right. We should devise a strategy and approach carefully.~
@481  = ~But now we have the element of surprise.~
@482  = ~Yaga-Shura's troops are still massing, returning from Saradush. We strike now in their disorder.~
@483  = ~Mayhap you're right, but one night at least. We'll pool our brains, we have good men and... women here.~
@484  = ~You have the power of gods, eh? You're invincible? Come on, chief, you've heard that.~
@485  = ~Glad you see it my way.~
@486  = ~Hmm! True, though one factor of many. Step carefully, but it's good to know you're thinking.~
@487  = ~Woah-hoh! Spoken like a true commander! I'd underestimated you, chief; lead on.~
@488  = ~I mean right by you, <CHARNAME>. If things go sour, I might save my own hide as usual; but after all this time, I'd not like to see you cut down.~
@489  = ~Woah-hoh! Now things get interesting. That Irenicus business, what with its tricks and turnings, put me in mind of my days with the Lizard; but this is a proper campaign. Esim would be proud of you, chief. What shall we do now?~ [adang135]
@490  = ~Reconnoiter here, I think. There may be local business to sort out.~
@491  = ~In truth, I wish I could flee all this.~
@492  = ~We have been tested against the Drow. I will attack Sendai.~
@493  = ~We know little of Abazigal, and he may be powerful, but I would find out for myself.~

@499  = ~Well. Can't say I blame you, but don't let the men hear. In fact I'd rather not know myself.~
@500  = ~It's good to hear you've a plan.~
@501  = ~Perhaps a sound idea, but then they might strike together. I think that hot wench's idea is best.~
@502  = ~Glib, chief, but we don't have much to go by. I suppose that's fair as anything.~
@503  = ~Fair enough, chief, though you'd do well to take our brains as well as our sword-arms, having the use of us.~
@504  = ~Oh--my captain in the Sembian corps. I thought I'd mentioned him.~
@505  = ~Knocking off Yaga-Shura was a hell of a stroke, chief. I have confidence in you, but these two seem to have their armies as well, and it's still but the six of us.~

@507  = ~And I couldn't ask for better, not ten thousand legions.~
@508  = ~I don't like it either, but we'll have to try our best.~

@512  = ~But we are used to fighting together.~
@513  = ~We are used to fighting together, and we are more mobile than an army. As I see it the odds are on our side.~
@514  = ~Fat lot of help they've been. The day I have to rely on some rosy-cheeked wench and a monk who can't stop looking down his nose, I'll hang up my sword.~
@515  = ~Heartwarming, chief, but that won't win the battle.~
@516  = ~At least you're honest. Don't go saying that too loudly, though, or we're apt to lose heart.~
@517  = ~(sigh)~
@518  = ~That sounds heroic, but there's something there. Perhaps you're right.~
@519  = ~Good thinking! Looks like you righteous types could teach rogues like me a thing or two.~
@520  = ~True enough, while their armies are hastily assembled. That counts for something.~
@521  = ~Woah-hoh! I admit, I'd never quite thought of it that wise. We're a proper death squadron, chief, aren't we. I like this better now.~
@522  = ~Thanks for hearing me out, chief. If we pull through this, it will be a war for the history books.~
@523  = ~Wah-hah-hah! We did it! Chief, I could hug you! Who would have imagined, who would ever have imagined? You're either brilliant or so strong the gods won't know what to do with you.~ [adang136]
@524  = ~You should have had more faith in me, Angelo.~
@525  = ~I told you I was invincible!~
@526  = ~Yes, these nitwits were no match for me.~
@527  = ~I couldn't have done it alone.~
@528  = ~Oh, I never doubted you. 'Cept for the odd moment. "Who would have imagined..."--figure of speech, beg pardon.~
@529  = ~And mayhap I'm starting to believe it.~
@530  = ~And mayhap I'd not be, either. Gorion sharpened that mind of yours.~
@531  = ~And I'm sure we're all touched, chief.~
@532  = ~You're not only a great adventurer, <CHARNAME>, you're a great general, and let history so record it. I would follow you anywhere.~
@533  = ~I'm a little ill tonight, chief. A whole city razed, hundreds dead... enough to turn even my stomach. But enough of that. How are you feeling?~ [adang137]
@534  = ~Thank you for asking. Not well.~
@535  = ~Thank you for asking. I am fine.~
@536  = ~Terrible.~
@537  = ~I'm fine, Angelo. Why shouldn't I be?~
@538  = ~I would rather not discuss this.~
@539  = ~That's no surprise, then.~
@540  = ~Truly? I find that hard to believe.~
@541  = ~Fair enough. Happen you ever want to, I'm here.~
@542  = ~M'lady, don't blame yourself for this. I've seen war and it's no fair, but then nothing is. Sometimes... people get hurt.~
@543  = ~Hurt, Angelo? Dead, dead and gone!~
@544  = ~But it was my fault. If I had only... ~
@545  = ~You are right. I will not let myself be troubled by this.~
@546  = ~What gave you the idea I'd be disturbed? What are a few hundred lives?~
@547  = ~Well... yes.~
@548  = ~Shh. Don't talk like that.~
@549  = ~Good on you, chief.~
@550  = ~Woah-hoh! M'lady... don't talk like that. Those lives meant much to the ones who had them. But I see my counsel isn't needed here.~
@551  = ~We did all we could. Shed a tear... one tear's enough. Then let's get to stopping these Five.~
@552  = ~I'll get them, Angelo. I'll make them pay for this.~
@553  = ~Yes, that is the only way to prevent more death.~
@554  = ~Why? What if I should become like them? I can't walk this path of death, Angelo.~
@555  = ~Right; but don't let your passion cloud your judgment. We wouldn't want to make a misstep.~
@556  = ~My thoughts exactly.~
@557  = ~I'll be blunt, m'lady: you've got no choice. You don't stop him, who in the hells will?~
@558  = ~No one has to carry all the damned misery of the world on her shoulders, <CHARNAME>. Remember that.~
@559  = ~Chief, you know I'm not a big one for jawing, but there's something I've got to get off my chest.~ [adang138]
@560  = ~What is it, Angelo?~
@561  = ~Speak.~
@562  = ~Just say it already!~
@563  = ~Not at the moment, Angelo; perhaps later.~
@564  = ~Well... I'm sure you don't need another reminder of the blood in your veins. Were I you, I'd not like to be put in mind of it. Still, you must know I have something to say, so I'll go on and say it. And I'll keep it short.~
@565  = ~<CHARNAME>, you're not the <PRO_MANWOMAN> your brother was. I've said it before and I'll say it again. I'm not a good man but I know goodness when I see it, and with the fetters put on you, it's a passing miracle. I admire that... and I'm glad of it.~
@566  = ~It hasn't been easy, but with the help of friends I've managed it.~
@567  = ~Of course! I'm not the slave of my blood.~
@568  = ~Yes. That's it exactly.~
@569  = ~I like to flatter myself I've learned a lot, but it's practical stuff; how to set an ambush, cure a hangover, get off a spell in a corner. About people I still don't know very much, and happen I never will. I don't know how one person ends up different from another, how one becomes Corellan, the other one Lolth. But I know some things help.~
@570  = ~<CHARNAME>, the way I see it, it's US that make you different. You may be strong, but so was Sarevok; but you keep us along, and happen sometimes you even listen. You know what it means to have a friend. Sarevok listened to no voice but his own, and so it started sounding like his dead sire.~
@571  = ~I don't know if I'd call you all friends, but you have been a help to me.~
@572  = ~That is right, Angelo, and I'm grateful to all of you.~
@573  = ~Sarevok was weak! I could have gotten this far without you.~
@574  = ~Do you call yourself my friend?~
@575  = ~Don't be ashamed of it, <CHARNAME>. I'm not. I've said even the wicked need friends, and you've no cause to be ashamed. A man who stands back-to-back with you in the front line is your friend.~
@576  = ~That's good to hear, chief.~
@577  = ~I would, <CHARNAME>. A man who stands back-to-back with you in the front line is your friend, and I've gone with you further than self-interest dictated. You are a welcome change from my former master, and happen you know me better than many a <PRO_MANWOMAN> I've served.~
@578  = ~What I'm trying to say is, I can't badger you one way or the other about this business. I said I'd advise you, but this isn't a decision I understand. All I know is I'm not afraid, because you aren't your brother; and my only advice is to ask the advice of these others, your comrades. I'll give you my own thought when the time comes.~
@579  = ~You're a wicked cuss, chief, and I'm sure you know it. But still you're not as bad as your brother. I've had fun traveling with you, and I'd not see you come to the same end.~
@580  = ~I have no need of advice. I am set in my course.~
@581  = ~Fear not, my brother was weak; I am strong.~
@582  = ~Silence, Angelo.~
@583  = ~Don't be so hasty, chief. Hear me out, for your own interest. What still separates you from that monster your brother was--is us. You've kept us along, and while I can hardly say you dandle us, you treat us like human beings. Sometimes you even listen to us. And in this business, I think you'd do well to listen, lest you end up like Sarevok.~
@584  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, how the damned miles pass like leagues in your company, and how like a sack of feathers this pack of mine feels. Happen any minute I might take flight and soar on ahead. A word apart?~ [adang139]
@585  = ~My love, a whole history.~
@586  = ~Certainly, Angelo, one word.~
@587  = ~I'm sorry, Angelo, we're hard-pressed; perhaps later.~
@588  = ~It's... a gross matter, chief. I hate to bring it to your ears when I'd give you sweet words instead. But the truth is, I've been worrying.~
@589  = ~Not about my heritage, I hope?~
@590  = ~It's about my heritage, isn't it?~
@591  = ~You are right to be worried, Angelo; we all are these days.~
@592  = ~No, it has nothing to do with the general big worry, chief. It's selfish, and I might add stupid, and cowardly.~
@593  = ~Truth is, I don't give a toss about your heritage. You've shown me you're not like your brother. I know I have nothing to fear from you.~
@594  = ~How can you be so sure?~
@595  = ~Thank you for this, Angelo.~
@596  = ~When you get to be my age, you know things, chief. I take pride in it. And I know no matter what, you'll do right by us. Happen I wouldn't like to see you ascending to some throne and leaving me, not so soon; but that's a matter for another day.~
@597  = ~This is about me, and it's about my age. <CHARNAME> when we first met, I said we'd put our cards on the table, and so I am. The fact is I'm nigh on fifty summers; and hells, however much I burn for you, that can't roll it back one year.~
@598  = ~You don't really think I care about that, do you?~
@599  = ~Angelo, that's... something I like about you.~
@600  = ~You've a few good years in you yet.~
@601  = ~That's not really what I meant.~
@602  = ~Ah-heh, I thought as much. But that's not really what I meant.~
@603  = ~You've hit on it, I'm afraid.~
@604  = ~A few good years is all I have. Chief, you know it, with the life I've led it's a cussed miracle I made it this far. Sometimes I wonder I don't have someone watching over me, after all. I've laid facedown in a ditch and been left for dead, I've been taken prisoner, I've been cut up, and you saw my last stunt yourself. And through all that the years took their price.~
@605  = ~I give myself a good round dozen of healthy years, happen our way of life doesn't catch me up in the meantime. I already know my legs aren't what they used to be. And, this is delicate chief, but there's but one way to say it. Only for half that time, a five year or so, I reckon I could... perform as a man.~
@606  = ~Chief, m'lady, you're young, and so gods-damned beautiful. You know it. You've a long happy life ahead of you. Years of smiles and laughter and all that. And I'd live it beside you, I'd ask for nothing more, but... I can't.~
@607  = ~Out of my hands, chief. I'm sorry. If I'd designed this world, you can bet it would be a sight different.~
@608  = ~You are being too pessimistic. Men live far longer than that.~
@609  = ~Angelo, I knew this, and I never cared.~
@610  = ~You make a good point. *sigh* I'd never thought of it.~
@611  = ~Aye, and far shorter, the most of them. You know I'm right.~
@612  = ~Then perhaps you should care now.~
@613  = ~I'm sorry to do this to you, m'lady.~
@614  = ~I'd not make you a widow in your prime. Whatever you say, I couldn't allow myself.~
@615  = ~But Angelo, what if I become a god?~
@616  = ~So... what are you saying?~
@617  = ~Let's not even think about that. You know I don't wish it, <CHARNAME>. Or do you mean you could... enhance me somehow? Heh. But then we'd be apart in any case, and it'd come to no good. Frankly, I'd rather die this moment with the memory, then live long as an elf like that.~
@618  = ~I'm saying this isn't fair to you, chief, and it was unfair of me to keep mum on it so long. I was afraid of it. But, now it's said, my advice to you. I love you more than anything and I'd not go to the grave without... having carried it through. You know what I mean.~
@619  = ~Let's have the night, one night together. I'd know you. Then... hells, seems like my throat conspires against me. Then go our separate ways. No hard feelings. Sensible business dealings, chief.~
@620  = ~Come again?~
@621  = ~Then are you set in this?~
@622  = ~No thanks.~
@623  = ~And what do I get out of this?~
@624  = ~It's what I advise. I told you from the start, you're the boss. All I can do is advise.~
@625  = ~Angelo, no.~
@626  = ~Then... I suppose you are right. The future you paint is a bleak one, but I would have this night.~
@627  = ~Of course not, who are you taking me for! If you want to break up with me, just do it.~
@628  = ~Then come to me, <CHARNAME>. All my love for you, and all the wasted love of fifty years, is in my blood now. Heh. Do you like that line? Just came up with it. I mean I'll do my damned best to see you enjoy it... chief.~
@629  = ~I hate to say it like this, <CHARNAME>... but do you have a better idea?~
@630  = ~I can't give myself to a man who will leave me in the morning. If we part, we must part now.~
@631  = ~Angelo... I really don't care about this. It doesn't matter.~
@632  = ~Angelo... I don't care so long as I'm with you. What will come will come.~
@633  = ~Angelo... I don't care so long as I'm with you. What will come will come. And if you should ever leave me, I would be true.~
@634  = ~Angelo... five years is enough for me. You know what I mean.~
@635  = ~If you want a whore for one night, find someone else.~
@636  = ~Then so be it. Farewell, <CHARNAME>. I won't serve you any less than before, and when you find your true love... I hope this memory has some place in your heart.~
@637  = ~Oh you cussed gods. What did I do to deserve this angel?~
@638  = ~Forgive me for this, <CHARNAME>. You are gold to my lead, but it is enough you love me. Let's go on as before, and sure enough, what will come will come.~
@639  = ~You mean you would take another lover. Don't blush, chief, I can see that is what you mean.~
@640  = ~But what more could I hope for? Just the sort of dealing I've known all my life, and you are sweet. Then so be it. I love you no less, and we'll make use of our time.~
@641  = ~Holla, m'lady--and my wife.~ [adang140]
@642  = ~Yes, my husband?~
@643  = ~What's on your mind, m'lord?~
@644  = ~Hmph.~
@645  = ~Heh, heh. And how does the conjugal life befit m'lady?~
@646  = ~Very well, though it seems things have not changed much.~
@647  = ~I certainly enjoy the... conjugal aspect. You know what I mean.~
@648  = ~I still find it strange. Perhaps I will get used to it in time.~
@649  = ~Wonderfully, Angelo. I feel safer and more at ease, I've never been happier.~
@650  = ~Heh. Perhaps not, although... ~
@651  = ~Woah-hoh! Ha, ha, ha; as do I m'lady, believe me. But... ~
@652  = ~Truly? Then I certainly hope it will be so. I only want your happiness.~
@653  = ~In truth, I know what you mean.~
@654  = ~It's passing strange. I felt nothing when the vow was made. Words spoken, that was all; but now... there's a change. I feel different in my bones.~
@655  = ~I can't say I know what you mean, but I am glad for you.~
@656  = ~As do I.~
@657  = ~My whole life I've known nothing but contracts. Some I honored, others I didn't. And this is a contract in the direst terms, worse than any; but it feels all free and natural.~
@658  = ~It was made in the eyes of the gods, and that is their way.~
@659  = ~It is strange, isn't it?~
@660  = ~To me it still feels formal, but we shall see.~
@661  = ~The contract was a formality. The freedom is all.~
@662  = ~If my old friends could see me now, what a mocking they'd give me! How many times I swore to some fellow in a bawdy-house--beg pardon, m'lady--I'd never marry, and he swore the same back. But now I look back and laugh at them. No matter how mad the world seems to this or that sod, I suppose there is a reason for everything, and there's a reason men marry--I know that now. But if I could meet them again, how could I find the words to tell of it?~
@663  = ~They just never found the right person, Angelo.~
@664  = ~They were all low-lifes. You are different.~
@665  = ~Well, they never knew anyone as incredible as me!~
@666  = ~Who knows?~
@667  = ~I suppose it comes down to that.~
@668  = ~Heh, that's hardly charitable of you, m'lady. They were as like to me as black to black, I assure you.~
@669  = ~Hee, hee! No doubt, no doubt.~
@670  = ~Who indeed.~
@671  = ~Still, it's strange. This was never my dream, except... in my most obscure hour, when I'd been in the cups, perhaps I wished for it as I wished I could slay a dragon. What of you, m'lady? Did you dream?~
@672  = ~It was my dream from when I was a girl, Angelo, and it has been all that I dreamed.~
@673  = ~I dreamed of it, yes. It was a childish dream, and I like the reality better.~
@674  = ~Never, it seems as strange to me.~
@675  = ~Oh, I meant never to marry. But I make an exception in your case.~
@676  = ~Then I am glad to hear it.~
@677  = ~Then it is all the more amazing.~
@678  = ~Hah! Then I thank you for that!~
@679  = ~Blessed, blessed world, blessed gods, blessed wretched me, blessed you. It is a dream I've no wish to wake from. I've done such deeds in your company, but when I'm dead and buried, write nothing but this on my stone: "Here lies Angelo Dosan--Happy--A married man."~
@680  = ~Good morn, m'lady.~ [adang141]
@681  = ~Angelo! You're up early.~
@682  = ~You were watching me sleeping, weren't you?~
@683  = ~Mm. Good morn, m'lord.~

@685  = ~You think I'm pre-etty! You like to wa-atch me!~
@686  = ~But of course.~
@687  = ~I was sitting up thinking. Times past, I've sat up the night, so engaged. But now... of course my nights are otherwise occupied.~
@688  = ~Ah, yes.~
@689  = ~Mmmm.~
@690  = ~Well I do beg your pardon!~
@691  = ~And believe me, I'd not wish it otherwise. (Ye gods, how does that sound?) What I mean is... m'lady <CHARNAME>, happy as the days are by your side, I oft find myself thinking on the night. Wishing the hours might pass quicker.~
@692  = ~Tell me about it!~
@693  = ~Well, let's not get carried away here.~
@694  = ~I've... not asked as much, chief, and it brings a blush to these dead old cheeks--if you believe that!--but... you've enjoyed yourself?~
@695  = ~"Enjoyed?" That is a mild way of putting it.~
@696  = ~What... can't you tell?~
@697  = ~I'll never tell.~
@698  = ~Well enough, but you are more than that to me.~
@699  = ~Heh! I thought so. You certainly have an appetite for it--gods that just slipped out, beg your pardon.~
@700  = ~Heh! I thought as much. Bodies never lie, they say, but it is good to hear the report confirmed by mouth.~
@701  = ~Heh, and by doubt, spur me on? Sly, sly, m'lady.~
@702  = ~As are you to me, m'lady. But... how can I say this... this is one thing I think I know how to do, and I'd not wish to disappoint.~
@703  = ~I'm pleased, <CHARNAME>, to give you what I can. And I'm... pleased with you.~
@704  = ~Happen I never told you as much, but past a doubt you noticed. I held myself back. I was afraid of this... that if we had it, it would be only this. The same thing I'd known before, always, and the rest would be lost.~
@705  = ~It hasn't been.~
@706  = ~These aren't polite words, chief. All the others mean nothing now. It was the difference between going to a fine meal and looking at a damned painting of food. And to think I might have died without knowing that. I thought I knew a lot, but I didn't know much after all.~
@707  = ~So, I hope I please you. It would be paying back a little of a debt.~
@708  = ~There... haven't been any others for me. You are all I know and all I want.~
@709  = ~Angelo, you should know, I have had other lovers. But it is the same for me.~
@710  = ~I've had other lovers. You rank fair among them.~
@711  = ~You do. I'm happy.~
@712  = ~Well, some day I hope to see the debt paid in full.~
@713  = ~Then let me be enough. I'm... honored, <CHARNAME>, take it for what it's worth.~
@714  = ~Truly, in a life so short and so hard? Not that I blame you. I'm glad to hear it.~
@715  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@716  = ~Ha, ha! And so you will, I swear it.~
@717  = ~Gods, look at you. When the gods made men and women, they did indifferent. When they made me, happen they were in the cups. But when they made you, lying there, the heavens from one end to the other gave one hot groan.~
@718  = ~Pretty. We've a hard day ahead, shall we be rising?~
@719  = ~"In the cups" indeed! They did a fair job in you.~
@720  = ~You have a drop of poetry in you, after all.~
@721  = ~Why, thank you.~
@722  = ~Right here. Right now.~
@723  = ~Aye, m'lady. Till the sun sets next.~
@724  = ~Fair enough, chief... but thank you. We should get moving.~
@725  = ~Hah! A drop such as poisons, perhaps. Till the sun sets next, m'lady.~

@739  = ~Ah heh, heh. Never meant to imply I'd love you more if you were... that is to say... I'll shut up now, anyhow...~
@740  = ~The customs are something. I suppose we'd need a go-between to sort of feel it out--between your dear father, and my mother. That could take weeks. And I don't imagine your father would too amenable on the subject of a dowry.~
@741  = ~Yes, I imagine he'd offer a trough of virgin's blood, or somesuch.~
@742  = ~Are you comparing MY father and your mother, Angelo?~

Now she thinks you'd look better in traditional clothes. Now she needs an errand run. The next day another errand. And all of a sudden the servants know gossip about you they could never have found out themselves.~

@776  = ~So, you gormless bug. I never wanted to look on your face again, but here you are. Have you come with more of your simpering "sorry"s, more pathetic words? I want none of it, and neither does my mother, these eight years in her grave.~
@777  = ~Eri... dead? I never heard of it. I swear I never heard, or I'd have... ~
@778  = ~No words! Listen, for once in your life; you always give advice but you never take it, coward. You wooed my mother, you lay with her, you whispered promises in her ear; for years you stayed; then you left her. Another damned notch in your belt, and she was ruined! From that day her life was a journey into the hells.~
@779  = ~Dosan! Ha, ha! What, frightened with false fire?~
@780  = ~I never meant... I meant to be true. I loved her. There was nothing I could do; I was called up... I had to go.~
@781  = ~And couldn't stay a moment to tell her? Hah. This is like watching a rat squirm under my bootheel. Could you sink any lower, man?~
@782  = ~What could I have told her? But I swear I loved her. Her hair... I meant to stay, I wanted nothing more. Shar. You were a good girl. You remember, I did everything for you, I walked with you, I bought you presents, I combed out your hair. Gods, what happened to you?~
@783  = ~For five years I amused you? Life happened to me, while you weren't there to protect me from it. I learned what you can rely on in this world.~
@784  = ~This isn't her, Angelo, it's your own voice speaking in her!~
@785  = ~Be strong! You must disbelieve it, as I did!~
@786  = ~She has a point, Angelo. What were you thinking?~
@787  = ~You left the both of us to be abused at the hands of men still worse than yourself. You are a wretch. You are craven. You are worthless!~
@788  = ~This is not true, Shar-Teel!~
@789  = ~Stop, Shar-Teel! Stop!~
@790  = ~Do not listen to her! It's all a lie!~
@791  = ~How could you, Angelo? How could you!~
@792  = ~What can I say? It knew exactly where to hit me. And in ways I know I'm weak. It came in a false appearance, but its every word was the truth.~ [adang143]
@793  = ~It spoke too hard, Angelo. We all do things we aren't proud of.~
@794  = ~I should say so!~
@795  = ~Perhaps, but you must put this aside for now.~
@796  = ~Someday... gods willing, I'll see her. And then... ~
@797  = ~Yes, we will try and find her someday. You should make amends.~
@798  = ~I think you've "done" enough for the girl already.~
@799  = ~Perhaps it's better to put the past behind us.~
@800  = ~Shar-Teel has become something you wouldn't want to see, Angelo.~
@801  = ~If such were possible. No... only to hear those words from her, to let her mock me, despise me. That may be all I could do.~
@802  = ~Hard words, <CHARNAME>, but fair. Perhaps you are right.~
@803  = ~Strange words from you, chief. You know better than anyone the grip it has on us.~
@804  = ~And whose fault is that?~
@805  = ~We should be on our way. This is my fault and folly, <CHARNAME>, not yours.~
@806  = ~Peace, m'lady, no watch tonight. You've been hard-pressed. Put yourself in my hands.~ [ADANG000]
@807  = ~Thank you... I would like that.~
@808  = ~You have been as hard-pressed as I. Let's rest together.~
@809  = ~Oh, but I do--and every night, Angelo!~
@810  = ~No, I must stand. We all shoulder the burden.~
@811  = ~Then lie back, chief, rest yourself.~
@812  = ~No, I've been slacking my duties like a beggar. Let me tend to you.~
@813  = ~Ha! I meant something different, though. Let me tend to you.~
@814  = ~Then so be it. (sigh) Chief, how you do it, I'll never know.~
@815  = ~These are spirits from Maztica I bought off a traveling merchant once. Strong stuff in the mouth, gentle going down the throat. Their warriors drink them, I understand, the night before a battle; they bring sleep quick, but put courage in the blood. I haven't much left but... give it a try, chief.~
@816  = ~Thank you, but you know I don't drink... liquor.~
@817  = ~Thank you, but I'm not sure I care for the smell.~
@818  = ~Eek! No thank you.~
@819  = ~I'll drink for you. Bottoms up, chief.~
@820  = ~Mmm.~
@821  = ~Mmmm!~
@822  = ~Blech!~
@823  = ~Hmm, this had better do what you said.~
@824  = ~Fair enough; none of that, then.~
@825  = ~Now, I'll have no sleep tonight. Take my bedroll; put it under yours. Gods know the ground is hard enough here.~
@826  = ~Oh, there's no need for that! I don't like being fussed over.~
@827  = ~Thank you; but you should get some sleep as well. Keep it.~
@828  = ~Thank you.~
@829  = ~Here, let me fix it for you.~
@830  = ~Now, chief, lie on your stomach if you please, and I'll unpin you... I tell you true, you've got an ogre's weight on these shoulders, they're hard as bricks. I know an art from Shou Lung to ease them with my hands. It's none of your ordinary backrub, it may sting a bit first off; but... certain ladies of my acquaintance (all in the past, I assure you) often found it to their liking.~
@831  = ~Mm, thank you.~
@832  = ~Why, Angelo, this wouldn't be a prelude to something... interesting, would it?~
@833  = ~Thank you, but no thanks.~
@834  = ~Really, this is unnecessary!~
@835  = ~Just relax now. Let it all lie flat... ~
@836  = ~Ouch!~
@837  = ~Ack stoppit stoppit stoppit!~
@838  = ~Heh! Not in the least, chief, I just want to ease you. Now relax...~
@839  = ~There, there. Smooth as the sea now, isn't it? That's what comes of carrying the world about on your back. My <CHARNAME>.~
@840  = ~Thank you for all this, Angelo. What's the occasion?~
@841  = ~Why are you doing all of this, Angelo?~
@842  = ~Angelo, you look sad. What's the matter?~
@843  = ~No occasion, no occasion.~
@844  = ~Because, chief. It's the least I can do.~
@845  = ~Nothing, chief. I assure you.~
@846  = ~Is there... anything else I can do for you?~
@847  = ~Tell me a story.~
@848  = ~I'm tired. Just tuck me in if you would.~
@849  = ~Yes, come here a moment. (Kiss him.)~
@850  = ~Why, yes. You can start by getting out of those clothes.~
@851  = ~Yes. Hold me in your arms.~
@852  = ~Heh. Ah.~
@853  = ~Heh, I thought it might come to that. M'lady I'd like nothing more, but... not tonight. On the morrow we fight. I think you should rest now, and... given our appetites, rest might be far off in th' other case. When this is over... oh, there'll be time, gods willing.~
@854  = ~And that be all? Yes, <CHARNAME>, I'd like that.~
@855  = ~(Angelo speaks as he strokes your hair.) Well, once it happened there was a right, good, virtuous maid, a king's daughter. And her, ah, kingdom, happen it was beset by a band of ogres. Led by the biggest and meanest of all. The king her father was old, and the army weak, and they took the castle by storm. They set up court there and wrecked the place, wiped their chins on the heraldry... terrible stuff, chief.~
@856  = ~Then the ogre king had the maid brought before him. Quite nicely, he told her they'd cut off her head and munch on her bones. But when they tossed her in the dungeon she, ah, by her wits she escaped; I don't quite know how. I didn't hear that part.~
@857  = ~Anyway, happen she got out of the castle, and met up with one knight who'd survived. They went through the countryside getting peasants, hermits, magical beasts, any who'd join the cause, and one day they marched on the castle and took it back from the ogres.~
@858  = ~Now the ogre king, he was brought before the princess. You can bet he looked a little abashed. The knight told the princess, cut off his head, it's the only right thing. But the princess said, then I'd be no better than him; and she pardoned him his crimes. Even the death of her father.~
@859  = ~And the ogre king started to cry. You know, big ogre tears, like a man's fist; and they made a pool like a lake in front of him. And happen he looked in, but what he saw wasn't a great ugly beast... he saw a man. And there was a man there, standing knee-deep in that lake...~
@860  = ~Asleep?~
@861  = ~Sweet dreams, then. 'Till the morrow.~
@862  = ~<CHARNAME>... m'lady. We look toward the future now. Hardly the time to think on the past again. Or mayhap you understand the temptation?~ [ADANG000]
@863  = ~Yes. I think of the past now more than ever.~
@864  = ~No, you are right. Now is the time to look forward.~
@865  = ~I'm sorry, Angelo, but as you know we haven't the time.~
@866  = ~You as well? Truly then, we are a right pair.~
@867  = ~You are correct, as always. But one word.~
@868  = ~No time? Aye, no time at all. Lead on then.~
@869  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you think there is Justice?~
@870  = ~What do you mean? Of course there are courts, laws, kings.~
@871  = ~Yes. It may be hard to see, but there is Justice.~
@872  = ~No. There is no Justice, only our wills.~
@873  = ~No. There is no Justice, only our fates.~
@874  = ~Truly, I don't know what to think.~
@875  = ~No, m'lady, not justice; Justice.~
@876  = ~Do you think so? Then would I could be so happy.~
@877  = ~Perhaps so.~
@878  = ~And neither do I.~
@879  = ~I think again and again on that play of ours. As it touches you, and my shame; but more.~
@880  = ~What more?~
@881  = ~Not this again. I told you it is over and done with.~
@882  = ~But my thoughts are new this time.~
@883  = ~The man who stands for the law is a proven rogue. The bigger thief hangs the smaller one. <CHARNAME>, nevermind you and I. But isn't that the perfect image of Justice?~
@884  = ~That the man who lived by lies holds the Law. And I... my whole life, I lived while others died. Others never escaped the Lizards, died in their crimes, but I got out. And in the army, battle after battle, I walked away where others lay there, cold. Semaj, Tamoko, Winski, your brother (though it seems death couldn't hold him) dead in the Undercity; I got up and walked.~
@885  = ~I stand before that desk just as you did, <CHARNAME>. Stand there a wicked man, self-condemned. And that judge, who would have hanged blameless you for your innocence, lets me walk--again and again.~
@886  = ~It was only chance, Angelo. Anyone alive can say they survived.~
@887  = ~You are not a wicked man! You were being given another chance.~
@888  = ~Angelo, what does this have to do with what lies ahead?~
@889  = ~I think that most likely, too. But that is as bad as malice on the world's part.~
@890  = ~That I could believe that. But what of those who never had another chance? I tell you they died stinking, food for the hells.~
@891  = ~Perhaps nothing. Perhaps little, perhaps much.~
@892  = ~M'lady, you're going to claim your birthright. Take it and you leave me behind.~
@893  = ~Angelo, I would never.~
@894  = ~Let us not speak of this. I will decide when the time comes.~
@895  = ~I would still be... with you. But it would not be as before.~
@896  = ~Don't be such a coward! Trust that I will do what is right.~
@897  = ~So you say.~
@898  = ~Aye, so you will.~
@899  = ~Nay, it would not.~
@900  = ~Right?~
@901  = ~M'lady, if you left me, that would be Justice. Then at last I'd be called to account. My whole life I left people behind, saved myself, left them to weep or to die. That seemed the way of the world to me. And now, shall the world prove itself... ?~
@902  = ~It was Justice when your brother turned his back on me. What right did I have to say he should return my love? I had spurned a thousand loves; that was the dealing I'd known. He was divine and he judged with the heavens' eye, no false loves, no sentiment. But in my weakness I'd have clung to him.~
@903  = ~Leaving and being left behind.~
@904  = ~M'lady, you are more than I deserve. A kind look from you would be more; and what I have had, words or imagination can't compass. It proves there is no Justice for rogues. But forsake me now, and you would prove the world.~
@905  = ~Angelo... I could never.~
@906  = ~What are you talking about? That is not Justice, you have changed.~
@907  = ~I care not. I would rather have you than prove the world.~
@908  = ~There is Justice, Angelo, but there is also forgiveness.~
@909  = ~Perhaps... you are right.~
@910  = ~I am not going to do this to punish *you*. You are not the center of the world, Angelo.~
@911  = ~Truly?~
@912  = ~Perhaps less than you think. I change, I am changeable; I swing back and forth. If you had been different so would I be.~
@913  = ~Sweet words.~
@914  = ~And I should have it, and not another? But I know you will say that all will have it.~
@915  = ~The choice is yours. You know what it means to me. But if you should choose... know, it shouldn't weigh your conscience. You would be doing right.~
@916  = ~I'll never believe it.~
@917  = ~I remember the sunsets over Ordulin. And when I was a trainee, cold and sweating in my cot bed--I'd thought I was hard in Kozakura, but there I was soft and green once again--it gave me comfort to look at. Dyed purple and gold by the smoke from the smelting-factories. And I thought to myself, there in the stone barracks window, I am the lowest creature the gods ever spawned; but I can still look on this. No less than any Paladin. And the world seemed strange and good to me for a moment.~
@918  = ~Forgive me. I don't know what I mean.~
@919  = ~Hold your head up, <CHARNAME>. You are triumphant now. The wheel of fortune rises and you with it, and whether I will rise with you, or be crushed underneath, should be no matter to you.~
@920  = ~Your pardon, my lady. Might I have a word?~ [adang000]
@921  = ~Certainly, Anomen.~
@922  = ~It's not about Angelo, is it?~
@923  = ~Perhaps later.~
@924  = ~M'lady... forgive me for my behavior during your nuptials. It did not befit a man of the Order, or indeed any man of good character.~
@925  = ~I forgive you, Anomen. I understand.~
@926  = ~Apology accepted.~
@927  = ~How could you! I could have died of shame, Anomen!~
@928  = ~My thanks for that.~
@929  = ~I am truly sorry.~
@930  = ~I only wanted to enquire... I wish you and your husband only the best, <CHARNAME>, but still I wanted to enquire... ~
@931  = ~I am listening, Anomen.~
@932  = ~Spit it out!~
@933  = ~Whether he's treating me well?~
@934  = ~Oh, I have no time for this.~
@935  = ~Whether he is treating you well.~
@936  = ~We are very happy together.~
@937  = ~No, Anomen. He beats me nightly. Gods, what do you THINK?~
@938  = ~We have our difficulties, but that is to be expected.~
@939  = ~It is none of your business whatsoever.~
@940  = ~I... see. I am... glad to hear it.~
@941  = ~I did not deserve that jest, m'lady.~
@942  = ~I see. Then, if you should ever... no! I will not say it. Forget this, <CHARNAME>.~
@943  = ~Aye, I suppose not. Thank you, nonetheless, for hearing me out.~
@944  = ~Holla, chief.~ [adang023]
@945  = ~(Flirt)~
@946  = ~I love you, Angelo.~
@947  = ~My love, there's something I'd like to talk to you about...~
@948  = ~Would you still love me if...~
@949  = ~Your leathers, Angelo...~
@950  = ~Tell me a war story!~
@951  = ~I hate to bring this up, but do you often think about death?~
@952  = ~Are you afraid of dying?~
@953  = ~What do you think happens to us when we die?~
@954  = ~You will tell me about your first love, Angelo, and gods help you if you lie to me again!~
@955  = ~No, really, tell me about your first love.~
@956  = ~You know I love you, but there's one thing about you that bothers me...~
@957  = ~What do you plan to do once this is over?~
@958  = ~Tell me about Shar-Teel's mother.~
@959  = ~I still want to know more about Kara-Tur.~
@960  = ~I still want to know more about Sembia.~

@963  = ~What should I do next?~
@964  = ~Have you ever done anything you WERE ashamed of?~
@965  = ~You talk sometimes about our gods, Angelo. Tell me more of the gods and faiths of Kara-Tur.~
@966  = ~What do you think of...~
@967  = ~Never mind.~
@968  = ~(Angelo colors.) And I love you, m'lady.~
@969  = ~Woah-ho! Sorry, I'm just not used to hearing it. But thank you--and I love you.~
@970  = ~Well, I don't love you even one bit.--Kidding, kidding! Put the knife down!~
@971  = ~(You probably should have waited until Angelo was done drinking from his hip-flask, as the spray of strong-smelling liquor across your face indicates. Wiping his mouth, he quickly nods consent and manages to say: "And I love you, m'lady.--Beg pardon.")~
@972  = ~Well, chief. For one thing, you have to understand, the stuff that blows West on the tradewinds. It can be... misleading.~
@973  = ~Take the samurai. A brave, fearless warrior, right? Honing his skill until his body is one with the blade? Hmph, don't make me laugh. This whole art of swordfighting didn't exist until the worst of the Omi war was over. In the old days, they wore armor and you hacked as hard as you could to break through it. Nowadays you have nobles, no armor, cooking up all these fancy techniques to use on each other. It's a damned game, that's all--granted, a game with stakes.~
@974  = ~And honor? Samurai aren't just warriors, chief, they're landowners. And you can bet they grind their peasants just as hard as any sod around here. They have honor with each other and nothing but contempt for everyone else. I knew one samurai in my life--his son, rather--and he was a proper bastard.~
@975  = ~Make no mistake, the mother country is just like my own dear mother. It sells itself, and people buy it... but I love it all the same.~
@976  = ~Truth be told, chief, I had a thought recently. You may find this interesting. Compared to Amn, or Tethyr, Sembia's a young country. And happen that's how they see themselves--a sharp, young fellow surrounded by dotards.~
@977  = ~And it may be that someday, your old ways will fall. No more kings or priest-lords. Nothing, not even magic, can stand up to the gold coin and its power over men's lives--that's what I've found. And when that happens, for better or for worse, Sembia's star will rise.~
@978  = ~Yes, m'lady?~
@979  = ~How would you live if you could live any way you wished? Say, you could cast a Wish spell ten Wish spells strong.~
@980  = ~What would you do if our places were switched? If you had Bhaal's blood in your veins?~
@981  = ~Actually, it was nothing.~
@982  = ~Truly, m'lady? In the Gate there was a saying, perhaps you've heard it: "If wishes were horses, beggars would ride." I like to think I haven't thought that way since I was a boy. Then, to be sure, I wished I was a king and such. And happen when I've had a few ales, the wishes come back.~
@983  = ~But, <CHARNAME>, I'm happy with my life. I've scratched out my living and I have you by my side. What more could I want?~
@984  = ~Hah! That's just what I wanted to hear.~
@985  = ~That's very mature of you, Angelo.~
@986  = ~But come now, all men have dreams.~
@987  = ~How boring!~
@988  = ~Ooh, look at the man's who's too grown-up to make any wishes!~
@989  = ~Then I'm glad I said it. But it's the truth.~
@990  = ~Well, happen for once the mind matches the body.~
@991  = ~More of the dead than the living, I've found.~
@992  = ~<CHARNAME>, if I have one wish, it's that the both of us make it through this safe. I wouldn't hold it against the gods if the same went for our friends. And that's all I would ask.~
@993  = ~Well, what about you?~
@994  = ~Well...~
@995  = ~Hey, I'm asking the questions here!~
@996  = ~Now if I told you, it wouldn't come true.~
@997  = ~As you wish. I think I could guess, though, when it comes to that.~
@998  = ~Be honest, now.~
@999  = ~A hundred million gold.~
@1000 = ~A spare Angelo, just in case you croak on me.~

@1012 = ~Now, don't we have at least a few of those handy?~

@1014 = ~Woah-ho! Scare me to death, why don't you.~
@1015 = ~You see what I mean? Wishing never does any good. We do what's in our power and that's all there is to it. Although...~
@1016 = ~<CHARNAME>, have your Wish. One Wish and one Wish only. But you can't wish for more wishes, and it has to be in the power of the one granting the wish.~
@1017 = ~Boo! I want more wishes!~
@1018 = ~Who's granting the wish?~
@1019 = ~No, Angelo, you were right. I wish for nothing.~
@1020 = ~No!~
@1021 = ~Heh. Smart.~
@1022 = ~I'm granting the wish. So, what would you have?~
@1023 = ~I wish for a kiss, that's all. But make it a good one!~

@1035 = ~Why do I get the feeling you're not taking this seriously?~
@1036 = ~What is this, wishing or daring? No thank you.~
@1037 = ~I prefer to keep my male parts intact, thank you.~
@1038 = ~Sorry, chief, that's in his power, not mine.~
@1039 = ~Sorry, not in my power.~

@1041 = ~Thy will be done, master. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a lamp to get back to.~
@1042 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, I admit the thought's crossed my mind. But first there's something I should tell you--happen I DO have Bhaal's blood in my veins.~
@1043 = ~What!?~
@1044 = ~If our lives were a story, this would seem like a badly-conceived plot twist.~
@1045 = ~You're joking. As usual. Right?~
@1046 = ~No joke, chief--but it's not what you think. You see... the night Sarevok and I came for his father, he was in a high state. I couldn't tell if he was excited, afraid, beginning to lose his grip once and for all... and looking back I still don't know. But there was an energy in the air, and we both felt we were on a desperate task.~
@1047 = ~We swore a blood oath that night. We cut our palms with my dagger and clasped them together; and an oath like that has power, even between villains. I suppose you may as well know that now.~
@1048 = ~Is that all? Way to get me worked up for nothing!~

@1054 = ~Not as such. But...~
@1055 = ~I felt something that night. Happen it was just the state we were in, but I'd never felt the like in my life. Happen it was a touch of your sire's power.~
@1056 = ~You're scaring me, Angelo.~
@1057 = ~Yes! Let it consume you.~
@1058 = ~What did it feel like?~
@1059 = ~Beg pardon, then. I would never have mentioned it, had you not asked.~
@1060 = ~Are you joking? I hope so.~
@1061 = ~It was enough for me, I'll say that. It made me feel like I could do anything, topple kingdoms, topple mountains into the sea. And happen that's what gave me the strength to do for my once-employer and one of the most powerful mages in Sembia. But you needn't worry, I never knew the like before, and I never want to again.~
@1062 = ~Yes, you had better not usurp my place.~

@1083 = ~(Angelo firmly returns your embrace. You stand together for a moment, and you smell the dry tannin on his leather and the sweat underneath it.)~

@1114 = ~Chief, it's not my choice, you know the lives we lead... but, perhaps, certain charming company might encourage me?~
@1115 = ~I warned you, didn't I? But for you, m'lady, anything. I'll see what I can do.~
@1116 = ~Beg pardon, chief, but I was once caught in the act by a half-dozen Tethyrian shadowdancers trying to take out the army brass. I fought my way downstairs holding up my chaps with one hand, a knife in the other, hid in a sewer and waited for the cavalry. A man's not the same after a thing like that.~
@1117 = ~On my honor, chief, I would never! You know it doesn't take much to set that one off. Mayhap he just finds us simians more amusing these days than unusual.~
@1118 = ~Ah. You can imagine I'd not have known, chief; who might have told me? But there is a cantrip to the purpose, and I'll look into it.~
@1119 = ~Sorry, chief, nervous tic. I'll see what I can do.~
@1120 = ~I'm afraid it's too late for that. You'll always be chief to me... chief.~
@1121 = ~Not even the strongest man can wash his own back, chief.~
@1122 = ~Fine. Fine.~
@1123 = ~Chief, the truth is sadder than any story I could invent. It cleaves my heart in twain to remember--but for you, and the trust you've shown me, I'll make a clean breast.~
@1124 = ~The truth is, when I was young, my mother would send me to spend the hot summer in a mountain town with her sister. Her sister was a proper householder, so happen she thought I could pick up some ordinary manners there. Anyway, I liked the town, and I could run wild in the woods all I wanted.~
@1125 = ~But one day when I went to the marketplace with my aunt, the two of us got separated. I ran into a little girl weeping her eyes out on the street. She wouldn't tell me what was wrong, but then I heard her stomach growling, so I went and bought her--we have these things in Kozakura, chief, fish-shaped cakes filled with sweet bean paste. They're delicious, and cheap if you buy 'em by the sack. So I brought them back and we ate them together, me and the girl who said her name was Sayuri.~
@1126 = ~It turned out she was crying because her mother had just transmigrated to paradise, as they say. But she made me swear to come back and eat fish-cakes with her again. My word wasn't enough--in Kozakura we swear by linking our little fingers, and if you break the oath, they say you have to drink a thousand needles. Yubikiri, they call it. So I swore an oath we'd meet again, and we did. We started to see each other every day.~
@1127 = ~What can I say? She was a jewel. Even young as I was I knew. She had this cute little sound she made when she got mad.~
@1128 = ~Now in the woods, there was an enormous old tree that must have been growing there since Toril was created. We said the tree was our school, where you could come and go when you liked, there were no classes, and you could eat fish-cakes all day. She liked to climb up and sit on the lowest branch of the tree and look out at the town. I never could, I was scared to death of heights. The lowest branch, I say, but it was still a ways off the ground.~
@1129 = ~And one day there was a gust of wind and she fell. Nothing I could do, and there she was, lying on the ground at my feet. I'll get you to the healer's, I said... but she was already going; it was too late. And she said, promise me. Promise me someday we'll meet again. And so I linked my little finger with hers and said, I swear... but I couldn't get my finger out of hers, because she'd already gone stiff. And that was how they found us, three hours later. They cut down the tree and that was the last summer I spent in that town.~
@1130 = ~Oh, Angelo, I had no idea...~
@1131 = ~How do you say 'liar' in Kozakuran?~
@1132 = ~That is far too dramatic to be the truth, Angelo.~
@1133 = ~You mean you bought that? I'm impressed, I guess my skills are improving.~
@1134 = ~"Usotsuki."~
@1135 = ~Usotsuki!~
@1136 = ~(sigh) Now, chief, wasn't that a good story? Wasn't it everything you could want? You're too set on knowing the truth. Life is one grand story anyway, and happen when our race is gone from Toril, if you took the history books and the tales and set them side-by-side, no one could tell the one from the other. We can only hope it entertains the gods, or whoever happens to inherit this dirt ball.~
@1137 = ~You're a persistent one, aren't you? Alright... <CHARNAME>. For you, anything.~
@1138 = ~There was a girl, her name was Sayuri, I sat behind her the one year I sweated out in the academy. Prepared you for civil service they did. I liked her. I never told her. She was from money, and she married money, and I never saw her again.~
@1139 = ~That's so sad.~
@1140 = ~Well... good.~
@1141 = ~Was she prettier than me?~
@1142 = ~Heh. What kind of way is that to talk? I thank my lucky star now.~
@1143 = ~Heh, don't worry, chief. I'm sure she'd not have a patch on you, now.~
@1144 = ~I don't remember. I'm kidding, of course she wasn't.~
@1145 = ~Honestly, chief? Things never seem to be over with you. I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up following you until one of us bought it, if you'd not object--and I'd not mind. I told you I've always been a lackey, and I've told you you're one of the better ones I've served.~
@1146 = ~Some day, though, I wouldn't mind going home. I wouldn't mind seeing the Gate again, either; that is if I could show my face around there.~
@1147 = ~What of them, m'lady?~
@1148 = ~They have got to go!~
@1149 = ~I want to know more about them.~
@1150 = ~Woah-hoh! Cut off my skin, why don't you!~
@1151 = ~How long have you been wearing them? You look like a starving beggar!~
@1152 = ~How long have you been wearing them? They smell like a bugbear's carcass!~
@1153 = ~Every day we find fantastic new suits of armor that would serve you better!~
@1154 = ~M'lady, you take me, you take the leather. Me and her, we've not been parted in nigh-on thirty years.~
@1155 = ~(sigh) Very well. I suppose I can't change you.~
@1156 = ~Did... did you just call them 'her?'~
@1157 = ~Ah, it's a manner of speaking. You know... like a ship.~
@1158 = ~(sigh) Very well.~
@1159 = ~They're an ancient suit of tattered leathers, Angelo, not a ship! This is ridiculous!~
@1160 = ~The leopard can't change his spots, chief.~
@1161 = ~Had 'em nigh-on thirty years, chief, and they've seen me through a scrape. They looked deadly sharp when I had them tailored. Not so much now, but you could say the same of me. Come to think of it, with the new patches, I can't say how much is left of the original. Likely I could recall where each patch came from.~
@1162 = ~Tell me about this patch, here.~
@1163 = ~Tell me about the right shoulder.~
@1164 = ~Tell me about the left shoulder.~
@1165 = ~Tell me about the chest.~
@1166 = ~It looks charred here...~
@1167 = ~Would you let me add a patch?~
@1168 = ~Happen that may be from the original! Looks like a lich's tongue, doesn't it?~
@1169 = ~Must have stitched it on a tenyear ago. If that acid arrow had struck a touch to the right, I'd have no head.~
@1170 = ~When a half-giant picks you up by the shoulder, it means something. Happened six year ago, I'd reckon.~
@1171 = ~You ever seen a dog worry a bone? Happen a dire wolf treats its prey the same way, but if you're lucky it won't get a deep hold.~
@1172 = ~Aye, there was a bad surprise in that guard automaton when I ran my blade through it.~
@1173 = ~That's... a pretty thought. Please, do. Then happen I'm telling the litany ten years hence, "and this was stitched on by a fine lady, <CHARNAME>, for the love she bore me."~
@1174 = ~Are you sure you want to hear this?~
@1175 = ~My life is a war story, Angelo. I can handle it.~
@1176 = ~No, perhaps you are right.~
@1177 = ~They're all in the same mold as the ones I've told, m'lady. When this is over, perhaps, I'll spin you another... if you've the appetite.~
@1178 = ~I warned you, didn't I?~
@1179 = ~It's a story, chief. It's in the past now.~
@1180 = ~Well, it happened once there was a breach in the council, and one of the princes, Antiono Spazzi by name, went his own way. Well enough, but Spazzi wasn't only a big bug, he had the support of quite a few little ones. Add to that he was a spellcaster of no small ability. The council knew it was trouble before the meeting adjourned and sent a courier at a dead run to the captains. That same night, three squadrons struck out for Spazzi's estate. But he was prepared, and he'd assembled a proper gang of mercenaries; orcs, demihumans for the most part...~
@1181 = ~It was dark when we came in sight of the place. When we reached open ground, the orcs rushed us from all directions. But we kept our heads, formed rank and the battle joined. Only then did we realize it was all a damned trick. With our thoughts on the orcs, and in such hurry, it had gone out of our heads that Spazzi was a mage--and as free of scruples as any good Sembian. He lay in wait nearby with his guards, and he unleashed some dire contingency, pouring down three cloudkill spells on our men and his alike.~
@1182 = ~I'd seen monsters choking under a cloudkill before. It's quite a different thing to see it done to a human being, much less one you know. I won't describe it. Suffice to say, we took a whole squadron of casualties in the first minute (and all his orcs were dead), and those that survived (I did somehow) did as we'd been trained.~
@1183 = ~Then what, then what!~
@1184 = ~Please, go on.~
@1185 = ~Eek! That's enough.~
@1186 = ~We played dead. I lay for twenty minutes under a pile of dead orcs, their smell and the burning gas in my mouth, before Spazzi decided he'd made us safe. He came down with his men and walked through the carnage, laughing. And when I heard his laughing come near me, I jumped up, and thank the gods a few of my friends jumped up as well. And we took our revenge, believe it. That's as much as is fit to hear, m'lady.~
@1187 = ~How awful! But I'm so glad you're safe.~
@1188 = ~Gods, why did I listen! I'll have nightmares!~
@1189 = ~Sounds like you were lucky.~
@1190 = ~You were right, it's nothing worse than what I've been through.~
@1191 = ~Now, naval engagements were never the Sembian corps' specialty; but Sembia has a coast, and given the gold coin is all but the national symbol, it's no surprise they have trouble with pirates. There was a big pirate lord, Rourke Olade, a Tethyrian; twice as tall as a man, they said he had ogre blood. Thinking our galleys were easy marks, he settled down, and the council knew something had to be done. They drafted half of us landlubbers into the navy. My captain said it was a bad idea, but they hadn't the gold to hire more trained sailors, not with Olade sapping their coffers.~
@1192 = ~Well, we set out on a fine day. Olade surprised us not a league out of port, in sight of the town. The numbers were on our side and we thought we had him. But have you ever seen a cannon, m'lady? I understand certain gnomes know the making of them, and they shoot an iron ball as big as your head, like a bolt from a crossbow. Not only did Olade have them, but he'd found a way to chain two such balls together. They spun through the air with a screaming like a hundred harpies, the two balls spinning around the chain, and the first one cut clear through our mast.~
@1193 = ~The captain was killed when the mast fell. It happened that left me the senior officer, but what did I know about a captaincy? It was mostly us on that ship, from the infantry corps, and we'd no notion of what to do. We were dead in the water, and then Olade's flagship made straight for us. It was near to a nightmare as ever I'd come in waking. He had a steel blade as big as a cliff tied to his prow and he rammed us, and the ship capsized and we were in the water.~
@1194 = ~I couldn't swim. I hung on for life to a piece of flotsam, me and Corporal Aegey. Olade was making passes, spearing the survivors with pikes, and the water was turning to red soup. Then like a flash, Aegey was gone. I felt the water turning under me. It was a gods-damned dragon turtle, chief, woke by the thrashing and blood, and I watched them vanishing left and right in front of my eyes. But then the gods were on our side. When it got bored with us, the dragon turtle rammed Olade's ship. Took it down with all his three cannons, and our fleet rallied, our mages scared off the turtle, and they fished out the handful of us who lived. I think Olade drowned, though as I recall they never found his body. Mayhap the turtle got him. And that's the story.~
@1195 = ~Well now, the longest campaign I had was against the green hags in the Stinking Marches. It was a bad business, the worst I had before I joined with your brother. We lost our captain, Esim, and I believe you know that story; and they had the terrain and gave us brutal losses for every league we made.~
@1196 = ~Happen in one engagement, me and six other sods were captured. I'm sure you can guess that didn't mean good. Hags, I understand, aren't much for keeping the rules of war, and the other six were dispatched promptly. I don't know and don't want to know what was done with the bodies.~
@1197 = ~But me, they spared. Gradually I figured out it had something to do with my tattoos. They were cunning but stupid, and they had me figured for something not human, some kind of being they might be able to get power from. So they kept me in a stone cell, probably miles underground. Didn't see the sun for weeks. Fed steaks so thick with mold you couldn't see the meat, gods know what animal they came from. During the day they beat me, gibbered at me in their tongue, and cast spells on me. Not a bit unlike an adventure of yours, chief.~
@1198 = ~But it came about there was an argument 'twixt two members of the coven. I could hear their shouting, and even blows exchanged, and they let me alone. Their forces suffered, and we made the final push and stormed the lair. I was so grateful to the man who rescued me I kissed him on the lips. I fully expected I would die in that hole, but gods know why things happen as they do. And that's the story.~
@1199 = ~Well... yes, chief. I've been around a long time; things happen. Only a few come to mind, and I'd not like to talk about them and I reckon you'd not like to hear, but to take an example...~
@1200 = ~Once, in the army, we put down a tribe of savages causing trouble in the mountains. Primitive people, different culture. But they gave us a hard fight, and we were bitter, and... well, there was some unfortunate business with the women. If my old captain Esim had been in charge, it never would have happened; but the sod was dead by then. I didn't join in but I didn't lift a hand to stop them. And that's the story.~
@1201 = ~Truly, chief? I can't see why you would be interested.~
@1202 = ~Matter of fact, your way of thinking suits me better. I've been away so long, the Kara-Turan faiths seem passing strange to me. You have your worship of the eight million gods, who as near as I can figure are just glorified spirits; then there's the Way.~
@1203 = ~Tell me more of the eight million gods.~
@1204 = ~Tell me more of the Way.~
@1205 = ~What do you think of "our" gods?~
@1206 = ~They've been around since ancient days, by the stories. Some are good, some are bad, some appear as animals, some as humans. To listen to some of the priests, there's a god in yon piece of stone. People pray to them for good luck, protection, nothing more. My mother was one such; she picked her god and hung onto him; and perhaps he did right by her, she's lived a time. It never meant much to me. It's no different from magic, is it, and I'd rather not be in hock to a spirit.~
@1207 = ~Nonsense as far as I'm concerned. Something to do with life being suffering, and how you can get out of it by not wanting anything. The first part I can agree with, but the day I give up desire is the day you won't be calling me Angelo Dosan. I'd rather wring what joy I can out of girls and drink, nevermind it won't fill some pit in my soul, or what have you. They're not selling anything I want.~
@1208 = ~I told you already, chief. I don't deny they're out there, but it seems to me they're all something less than what they claim. Look at your father! If they can become mortal, what's so godly about them? I can understand dealing with them like kings, but not giving your life to them. The whole thing confuses me. Sometimes I tip a priest a copper to pray for me, and hope it works out in the end.~
@1209 = ~What do you make of it, you holy roller?~
@1210 = ~In knowing and loving my god, I know and love myself.~
@1211 = ~My god shelters and watches over me.~
@1212 = ~My god teaches me how to live properly.~
@1213 = ~We all must serve a god, and I wish to serve mine more than most.~
@1214 = ~All gods are emanations of Ao, the All-Father, and in serving them we serve the very will of the cosmos.~
@1215 = ~In honesty, Angelo, sometimes I have doubts about this path.~
@1216 = ~It is a way to gain power, nothing more. My god would wish no less.~
@1217 = ~I'm not sure I understand, but if that works for you, good on ya.~
@1218 = ~Fair enough. I suppose you can use all the help you can get.~
@1219 = ~Fair enough. They seem to be doing their job, then.~
@1220 = ~Do we? Perhaps. Fair enough, then.~
@1221 = ~Whoa-ho! That's a new angle. Give me a few years to wrap my head around it.~
@1222 = ~I see. Well, you'd best sort it out with the big man or woman, then; I'm no confessional.~
@1223 = ~Fair enough, chief.~
@1224 = ~Ah... no. No I don't, chief; not if I can help it.~
@1225 = ~I came out with that, before, because I don't think about it; but it struck me that I should have; and so it all came out at once. Of course I do think about it, but it's at the back of my mind, or somewhere in the middle.~
@1226 = ~Who isn't, chief? Afraid of the pain; but moreso, afraid of who I'll meet on the other side. Now, also, of what I might leave behind.~
@1227 = ~Honestly, chief, I couldn't tell you. I've even met a few who say there is no soul, and when we die, we snuff out like a candle. I'm not mad enough to believe that, but when I think on the afterlife, the prospects don't look good. I expect the hells, if not something worse.~
@1228 = ~Truth tell... I've never told anyone this before, chief. But I have a dream sometimes, of walking around a field, and it's cold and misty and I'm alone. Happen I wake and think that's the hell in store for me. A small rogue of my type doesn't merit torture by demons; what do they care? No...~
@1229 = ~Well. What do you think?~
@1230 = ~Perhaps after all this life is all we have, and we must make the most of it--with each other.~
@1231 = ~That would never happen, Angelo. You deserve the heavens.~
@1232 = ~I won't lie, Angelo; the hells perhaps. But you would be purified, someday redeemed.~
@1233 = ~The world runs towards a purpose. Someday all will be redeemed, Angelo.~
@1234 = ~Then life is less than a dream and worse than a joke. That may be, <CHARNAME>, but I'd never like it.~
@1235 = ~My heavens, or yours? I don't understand the thing at all. And would I even like the heavens? I'm not sure I'd fit in.~
@1236 = ~What a hell of a thing to say! Hah. Well, I'll take your bond for it, chief. Try to put in a good word for me.~
@1237 = ~All? Even me? Even your brother?~
@1238 = ~This makes my heart heavy. What will come will come. Let's try not to dwell on it, eh?~
@1239 = ~I think you know what to do. I'm right behind you.~
@1240 = ~Eri was a nice girl. Yellow hair. Not really all that pretty, come to think of it, just had something about her. Childish nonsense; I was only tweny-eight summers, I think.~
@1241 = ~Do you think she loved you?~
@1242 = ~Would you have another child?~
@1243 = ~(sigh) It's hard to say. She was young, too. Let's not talk about this anymore, chief.~
@1244 = ~No.~
@1245 = ~You and I, chief? Heh. If it would make you happy, perchance, but you see what a job I did by the first one. The day's far-off yet. For what it's worth, I advise we get a dog. I'm fond of dogs.~

@1260 = ~Nalia.~
@1261 = ~Valygar.~
@1262 = ~Yoshimo.~
@1263 = ~Sarevok.~
@1264 = ~Psst. Put in a good word for me when this is over, would you? I wouldn't mind soothing that poor widow's broken heart, heh, heh.~
@1265 = ~Strangely, chief, hard as I try, I can't find a fault here. A half-elf. Brains, and years before she loses the looks.~
@1266 = ~<CHARNAME>. Tell her I'm sorry, would you? Maybe she'll listen to you.~
@1267 = ~This just occurred to me. How long do rodents live? What'll the poor sod do when it dies?~
@1268 = ~Truth tell, chief, I'm amazed he's stuck with you this far. But then look who's talking.~
@1269 = ~Now I've been in the Underdark, I wonder the wench can stand it up here. A few years living down there and I'd be a madman. Come to think of it, maybe that explains quite a lot.~
@1270 = ~Put out your hand--here. Calimshan Red Lotus skin balm. You don't get lucky tonight, I'll not be to blame, chief.~
@1271 = ~After you've known him a while, I find you get used to the constant noise, as if you lived 'neath a waterfall.~
@1272 = ~If I hear the word 'nature' one more time, I swear...~
@1273 = ~I suppose she's proven herself. Amazing what a scant few months on the road can do to a lass.~
@1274 = ~Who'd have thought that walking bed of daisies would actually prove of use?~
@1275 = ~It's working out, eh? I'm not sure what I think of this. If you break it off, let her down gently, eh?~
@1276 = ~If we find another good katana, I call dibs on it.~
@1277 = ~Can you believe he hasn't tried to convert me to Torm even once? Gods, I almost love the man.~
@1278 = ~The little man's grown up. I'm honored to fight beside him.~
@1279 = ~Heh, heh. Now we'll see if those Order sods are really celibate, eh?~
@1280 = ~If the Lady of Pain comes after him riding on a flaming chariot made out of rose thorns, we don't know this sod, chief.~
@1281 = ~I like her hair.~
@1282 = ~Really, this won't end well. We ought to dump the mad cuss as soon as we can, chief, before he gets too much to handle.~
@1283 = ~It's a gods-damned shame, chief, but what can you do?~
@1284 = ~I got nothing to say, chief.~
@1285 = ~There's no right answer to this question, is there? Well, after all I grilled you, fair's fair.~
@1286 = ~I ascended?~
@1287 = ~A curse turned me hideous?~
@1288 = ~I were old?~
@1289 = ~I turned as evil as Sarevok?~
@1290 = ~I were unfaithful?~
@1291 = ~I didn't love you?~
@1292 = ~I were dead?~
@1293 = ~I were a man?~
@1294 = ~Would I? Of course, no less than ever. Would you love me? Perhaps; but could you love me? Let's not think about this, <CHARNAME>.~
@1295 = ~Gods. <CHARNAME>, let me put it this way. Of course I would, my dear, sweet darling. But if there were a way to break the curse, I'd think we'd both try our damnedest.~
@1296 = ~What, overnight? I'd have to think about that. I mean it would be quite a shock. I mean of course I would.~
@1297 = ~I'd never believe it, but yes. And here I entertain some silly fancy that I could redeem you. Hah! That'd be the day.~
@1298 = ~<CHARNAME>, I've seen firsthand what jealousy does to a man. Of course I'd be angry, I'd not lie, but I'd be angry because I loved you; and I'm sure a word from you would dissolve it all. Yes.~
@1299 = ~<CHARNAME>... it's hard to love where you're not loved in return. Don't ask me these questions, I'm on edge as it is. You are my dear and I love you.~
@1300 = ~What do you mean? Of course my damned heart would break; because I loved you. But if we're talking going down to the hells to fetch you back, well then I'm not so sure... ... kidding, chief, kidding! Of course I'd do it.~
@1301 = ~That's a stumper there.~
@1302 = ~Ah... <CHARNAME>, if you were a man, I'd get some cursed gadget that turned me into a woman. (There, I like that. Safe!)~
